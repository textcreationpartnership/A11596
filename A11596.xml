            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus Maieſtrates are called<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 13.6.</note> ſeruants of God, becauſe in gouernment they doe, or ſhould doe him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.

Secondly, otherwiſe Chriſt muſt be a diſtinct God from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he is a diſtinct perſon. Thirdly, if the eſſence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17336:15"/> beget, and be begotten, then muſt there be two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences in the Deitie, one begetting, the other begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;<note place="margin">Lib. de Chrſto <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>

And to ſpeake properly, that which the father giues to the Sonne, is not the diuine eſſence, but the perſonall exiſtence, or manner of being in the Deitie: neither hath Chriſt from his father, this to be God: but this onely, to be the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>For the manner or meanes how he receiues his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or perſonall being in the God-head, it is by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or begetting; the manner whereof as it is, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable. Yet ſomething may be conceiued and ſpoken whereby it may be ſomewhat ſhadowed out to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Some ſay he is ſo begotten of the Father, as light of the Sun, by a ſimple emanation. The fathers make choiſe of the metaphor vſed by the holy Ghoſt to explane this myſterie: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. as ſpeech is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and begotten of the minde without any paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alteration, fluxe, or deciſion; ſo as the ſpeech is in the minde, and the minde in the ſpeech: ſo Chriſt of God the Father. <hi>Augustine.</hi> The minde is as it were the bringer forth, knowledge as it were the off-ſpring, or child of the minde: for the minde while it viewes it ſelfe, begets the knowledge of it ſelfe, which is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of it ſelfe.

I meane not here ſo much as to mention the hereſie of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> or of the <hi>Acephiah</hi> his off ſpring; for I hold <hi>Hyperius</hi> his aduice good, that a miniſter in his popular Sermons ſhould content
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17336:17"/> himſelfe to deale againſt the errours raigning for the preſent in the people, rather then by needleſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of buried hereſies, giue them occaſion to inquire into them.</p>
                  <p>Onely ſo much as our vbiquitaries haue of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, of theſe groſſe hereſies, I will briefely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and as briefely confute. Now from this ground, I thinke it will follow, that ſith the natures are not confuſed, or tranſ-fuſed each into other, the properties alſo muſt needes remaine to eyther nature, without this ſuppoſed transfuſion each into other: for that rule I thinke will neuer be diſproued; confound the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yee confound the natures: take away the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yee take away the natures: transfuſe the properties, yee transfuſe the natures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if properties be thus transfuſed; I demand whether this transfuſion be mutuall, or reciprocall or not, that is, whether as diuine properties are transfuſed into the humanitie; ſo humane alſo into the diuinitie: and ſure I ſee not, but that from the ſame ground of perſonall vnion, we may as well ſay, that mortalitie is really transfuſed into the Deitie; as vbiquitie into the humanitie: for whereas they ſay, the God-head is not capable of infirmities humane, &amp;c. wee may as truely ſay, that the man-hood is not capable of diuine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, as they are diuine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if diuine properties be ſo communicated vnto the humanitie of Chriſt, that therby the humane nature becomes omnipreſent, &amp;c. why not alſo other properties of eternitie, a <hi>parte ante;</hi> immortalitie, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, all being equally out of the ſame grounds dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible as any one?</p>
                  <p>Now ſhall we a little ſee their reaſons? they may all be referred to theſe three. Firſt, perſonall vnion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that phraſe vſed by the fathers, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17336:17"/> of propert es. Thirdly, ſtate of glorie. Now if it be proued vnto vs, that neither of theſe proue ſuch a transfuſion as they imagine, I hope our people will be armed ſufficiently againſt the errour of vbiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>For the better diſcerning of the inconſequence of the firſt reaſon, it ſhall not be amiſſe a little to enquire. Firſt, what perſonall vnion is. Secondly, what it is that the humanitie of Chriſt thereby receiues.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, perſonall vnion, it is the vniting and knitting of God-head and manhood together: whereby is made one perſon of the mediatour: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are three things. Firſt, that it is an vnion, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of two one. Secondly, the things thus vnited; Godhead, as it is limited to the ſecond perſon in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and manhood. Thirdly, the terme of this vnion, they are made not one nature, but one perſon of the mediatour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, weigh what it is, that the humane nature receiues hereby. Firſt, ſubſiſtance in the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinitie, whereof it ſelfe is of it ſelfe deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, extraordinarie dignitie, inſomuch that it is a peculiar temple for the Deitie of Chriſt to dwell in, and wherein it ſhewes and manifeſts it ſelfe, more gloriouſlie then in any creature. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, more neere familiaritie with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head then any other creature, Angels, or man, hath or can haue.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, an extraordinarie meaſure of habituall graces; of vnderſtanding, wiſedome, holineſſe, &amp;c. Such as in that meaſure dwels in no creature. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14.15.16.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, a partner agencie with the Godhead, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its meaſure in the workes of redemption and mediation.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:17336:18"/>
                  <p>Now the vbiquitaries adde hereto a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diuine nature and properties to the manhood, ſo as to be informed and actuated thereby: inſomuch that the humane nature receiues into it ſelfe, from the Deitie, a power to be omnipotent, omniſcient, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent in it ſelfe: a thing that cannot agree to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, without being made God; for that which ſome obiect, that notwithſtanding this kind of hauing diuine properties communicated, yet the manhood is not Godhead, becauſe it hath them not of it ſelfe, but by participation from another, is friuolous; for howſoeuer theſe things be had, if they be had, as they teach, ſo as to informe the ſubiect wherein they dwell, they make it God: in as much as theſe things are diuine properties, inſeparable from the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor can any thing be ſaid to be properly omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, omnipreſent, &amp;c. but it muſt be confeſſed withall to be God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> How then are theſe communicated vnto the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in Chriſts perſon? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Euen as the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe and none otherwiſe, that is, ſo as they dwel and ſhew themſelues in manhood; and ſo as that the manhood vnited vnto the Godhead, may ſay of them they are mine, not by way of information, but in reſpect of poſſeſſion after a ſort: <hi>Ratione ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that this being all that by vertue of perſonall vnion acrewes vnto the manhood of Chriſt, it will be impoſſible from them to infer ſuch a communication of diuine properties vnto the humanitie as vbiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries dreame of.</p>

God purchaſed the church with his bloud; not that the Godhead ſhed bloud, but becauſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was God ſhed bloud to procure redemption: not which it had as God; but which it had in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood vnited vnto it: ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. the Sonne of man talking with <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> is ſaid to be in heauen: not that as he was man he was in heauen, while he was on earth; but becauſe that perſon that was ſonne of man, was by ſomething in his perſon, that is, by his Deitie, in heauen: ſo in this place, where wee haue a patterne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, to interpret all ſuch alternate predications: the Sonne of God is ſaid to be made of the ſeede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> but how? according not to his diuine Sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but according to his humane nature, vnited to the Sonne of God: and how will it hence follow, that becauſe the properties of the diuine nature, may be enunciated of the perſon denominate, in the concrete of the humane nature, therefore the diuine proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are communicated to the humane nature ſo as to informe it. And as a learned Diuine and <hi>Logitian</hi> ſaith well, if theſe men had learnt in this point to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>predicata abſoluta,</hi> and <hi>limitata,</hi> we ſhould ſoone ſee an end of all theſe vnſeaſonable and bitter contentions betwixt brethren.</p>
                  <p>Their third ground is, the exaltation of Chriſts humane nature to the ſtate of glorie, and that which they call <hi>ſtatum maieſtatis,</hi> whereinto Chriſt entered at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17336:19"/> his aſcenſion: whereby they ſay Chriſt in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, receiued an infinite power and glorie, &amp;c. and ſo this power to be euery where preſent.</p>
                  <p>Now that Chriſts manhood receiued not by that his exaltation to the ſtate of maieſty and glory, any ſuch nature of being omnipreſent, the other grounds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly laid doe eaſily euince: for as perſonall vnion makes not the manhood God, ſo neither doth exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into ſtate of glorie: for that is ſtill manhood though exalted vnto glorie; and therefore though he receiued glorie more then any creature beſides; yet not this glorie for his manhood to be God, or to haue any ſuch propertie, vpon hauing whereof, it muſt needs follow that it is God: for it's ſtill a creature finite, &amp;c. though the moſt glorious of creatures, yet a creature; God hauing ſaid that he will not giue his glorie vnto any creature; no not to the humane nature of Chriſt. Much more might be ſaid to this purpoſe, but that I remember for whoſe ſakes I pen theſe obſeruations.</p>
                  <p>For vs let vs learne from the Apoſtle, how to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all theſe places of Scripture, where weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are giuen to God, Chriſt, or diuine excellencies, vnto man Chriſt, namely thus, that they muſt be taken as ſpoken, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To which <hi>Aquinas</hi> his anſwere is this; that that, <hi>non omnino,</hi> is not a word of abſolute deniall, but of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſtraint, and the force of it is this (ſaith he) not that a Chriſtian may not ſweare in any caſe, but that he muſt not ſweare in euery caſe, but where neceſſitie and importance ſhall require it. Howſoeuer it be it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that our Sauiours drift is this, to proue againſt the gloſe of the Phariſies, that the Lord in the third commandement, forbids not onely falſe but vaine ſwearing, whether by God, or by the creatures, wherein the maieſtie of God ſhines and ſhewes it ſelfe; and from the place thus expounded, it will be impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Anabaptiſts inference.

And ſecondly that which by ſuch othes they ſeeme to auoide, they doe vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly incurre; euen the ſwearing by God himſelfe; whoſe glorie ſhines euen in the baſeſt of his creatures, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.22.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond fault here reproued, is vaine and needles ſwearing, when things are eyther ſo euident of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they need no ſuch confirmation, or ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, that they require not ſo great a witneſſe: a ſinne ariſing from our little reuerence and eſteeme of the maieſty of God: a righteous man feares an othe,<note n="g" place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.2.</note> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Sathan, as the firſt authour;<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 5.37.</note> leading to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a iuſt recompence, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                  <p>A third and moſt haynous abhomination here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, is that helliſh ſinne of periurie, and falſe ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; common at this day, not onely in our knights of the poſt, that haue ſold themſelues to Sathan to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of God; but amongſt

                  <p>To that might be added, that which is not onely coſen-germain to periurie, but an high kinde of this helliſh forſwearing, equiuocating in an othe, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dallying with the name of God: Secondly, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Magiſtracie, Gods holy ordinance: Thirdly, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the very maine end and vſe of an othe:<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> but hereof more at large in due place.</p>

                  <p>The firſt queſtion betwixt vs and them, is touching the terme and name of iuſtification what it ſignifies; whether making righteous, or pronouncing righteous; they vrging the Etymologie of the word, and ſome texts of ſcripture, for the greateſt part detorted, to proue the firſt acceptation: we ſticking rather to the ſecond, hauing the Apoſtle for our interpreter. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>

                     </note>Now for the Etymologie of the word; whereas they ſay that the very Grammaticall notation proues their interpretation, let them remember what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf ſpeakes in another place, <hi>in eo errant multi</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quod vocum ſignificationes ex Etymologia potius du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, quam ex communi ſcripture &amp; bonoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authorum vſu.</hi> Its the errour of many, that they fetch the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of words rather from their Etymologie then from the common vſe of Scripture, and good authors.

                  <p>Howbeit, for my part I ſee not but wee may grant them this notation of the word to ſtand euen in this queſtion; ſo be it we ioyne not with them in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition touching the manner how a ſinner is made righteous in the ſight of God; this they ſay is done by infuſion of habituall righteouſnes; which we muſt vtterly deny, except wee will contradict the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>Let me a little with good leaue of my more learned brethren, to whoſe cenſure I ſubmit my ſelfe, propound my iudgement herein.</p>
                  <p>I take it therefore that without any preiudice to Gods truth, we may grant them that notation of the word, to ſtand in this queſtion: ſo that to iuſtifie ſhall ſignifie to make righteous; to be iuſtified to be made righteous. And if I be not deceiued, the Apoſtle thus vſeth it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. but yet that infuſion of habituall righteouſneſſe, they dreame of, hath here no place, though it be one inſeparable companion of our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For better explanation, I will a little declare
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17336:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> the proceedings of the Lord with a ſinner in iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is as I take it in this manner. Firſt, by effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling he workes faith; by faith vnites him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, ſo that he is made one with Chriſt; thus vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he hath intereſt to Chriſts righteouſnes; hath true righteouſnes in his head; both paſſiue for ſatisfaction, and actiue for acceptation; which is truely his in reſpect of right, vſe, fruit; hauing thus apprehended Chriſt, and made him with all his merits and obedience his owne, he ceaſeth to be a ſinner in reſpect of guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God ſtriking of his ſcore, cancelling the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, in a word, forgiuing his ſinnes, and making them ſo as if they had neuer beene; and ſo pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him righteous; and accepts him to life eternall. And ſo we yeeld them their heapes of premiſſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they labour to driue vs to abſurdities: and auouch that Gods iuſtice is not impeached by our doctrine of iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>It is true that they ſay, GOD doth not iuſtifie the wicked: that is, acquites him, or holds him guiltleſſe while he is wicked, and yet we ſay with all that GOD doth acquite a beleeuer and holds him guiltleſſe, and that doing thus, hee iuſtifies not a wicked man, but a righteous man; though not in himſelfe, yet in his head Chriſt Ieſus: And of the terme let this ſuffice, this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being annexed, that to iuſtifie, imports theſe three things one deſcending on other. Firſt, to make righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by ingraffing into Chriſt, and imputing his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe vnto vs: Secondly, to abſolue from ſin which follows the former imputation: Thirdly, to pronounce and accept as righteous.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the ſecond controuerſie betwixt vs and them, and that is what that righteouſnes is, by which a ſinner is made righteous in the ſight of God, and ſo acquited from his ſinnes, pronounced righteous,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17336:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> and accepted to life eternall: they ſay it is a mans owne innocencie, habituall and actuall righteouſnes merited indeed by Chriſt, but inherent in vs as in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: we vtterly diſclaime this, and teach that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes whereby a ſinner is made, eſteemed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as righteous before God, is the righteouſneſſe wrought by Chriſt, inherent in him onely as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubiect, made ours by faith, that is, by beleeuing it to be ours, and wrought for vs.</p>
                  <p>Where the third controuerſie offers it ſelfe to be conſidered; <hi>(viz.)</hi> what kinde of faith this is, and how it concurreth to iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>By faith they vnderſtand, a generall acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the articles of faith, and an aſſent to them as true. Wee a particular aſſurance, that what Chriſt wrought and merited, he wrought and merited for vs.</p>
                  <p>Faith againe, they teach to be a part of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes as other vertues alſo. We not a part, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument onely to apprehend and receiue it offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the Goſpell. And therefore our Diuines ſay well, that faith is here to be vnderſtoode with his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the obiect being indeed that that doth iuſtifie vs; faith being but the inſtrument to receiue it, as the hand may be ſaid to feede or nouriſh the bodie; not that any nutritiue vertue is in the hand, for that is onely in the meate; but becauſe the hand is an inſtrument to conuaigh the meate into the ſtomacke, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus explained the queſtion, let vs reſume the concluſion, as it is here expounded, and ſo apply the proofes here ſet downe by the ſpirit of GOD. The concluſion is this, that the righteouſnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is iuſtified in the ſight of GOD, is the righteouſnes of faith, that is, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, apprehended by faith: and not the workes of the law eyther naturall, ceremoniall, or morall, done
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17336:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> by vs eyther before or after grace: and this Text af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords for proofe foure inuincible arguments. Firſt this, the righteouſnes whereby a ſinner is iuſtified in the ſight of God, is onely that righteouſneſſe which God only hath wrought in Chriſt; called here the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God in oppoſition to mans righteouſnes, as alſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 3. but ſo is onely the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of faith, not that of workes, <hi>Ergo.</hi> For though it be true, the aduerſaries themſelues, confeſſing that our actuall righteouſnes is the worke of God in vs, yet this with all they teach, and that truely, that in the exerciſe thereof, there is a concurrence of our will, and other powers of ſoule and body with the grace of God, and we are in them in ſome degrees <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> fellow-workers with the grace of God, but this righteouſnes whereby we are iuſtified, is wholly of Gods working in Chriſt, therefore by faith, and not by workes, are we iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in Gods ſight.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon, is from the inſtrument and meane of Reuelation: which is the Goſpell, and that onely. Whence I thus reaſon: the righteouſnes whereby a ſinner is iuſtified in the ſight of GOD, is reuealed in the Goſpell onely, the law Morall neuer diſcouering it: but the righteouſneſſe of workes, is reuealed and taught in the law, therefore that cannot be the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes whereby <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs to be iuſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle here directly auoucheth, that it is the righteouſnes of faith, and proues it by the teſtimonie of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> whereby we are iuſtified, and ſo ſaued; therefore not the righteouſnes of workes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. &amp;c. the Apoſtle at large proues that all both Iewes and Gentiles, are breakers of the law. Whence a fourth reaſon ariſeth on this manner:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17336:51"/> no tranſgreſſour of the law can be iuſtified by the law. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9.10. but euery man, Iew and Gentile, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and regenerate, is a tranſgreſſor of the law: therfore no man can be iuſtified by the workes of the law: theſe are the reaſons laid downe in this chapter.</p>

                  <p>But let vs a little turne backe to the words of the Text, and ridde them of ſome difficulties, and gather what may be gathered from them for our further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From faith to faith.]</hi> The words are diuerſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and their connexion diuerſly expreſſed: ſome referre them to the former words thus: by the Goſpell the righteouſnes of GOD is reuealed from faith to faith; that according as faith increaſeth, ſo is this righteouſnes of God, and our intereſt thereto, more and more made knowne vnto vs, and this is a truth, though I take it not that here entended; for I take it the Apoſtle ſpeakes here of the generall propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this righteouſneſſe of GOD in the Goſpell, not of our apprehenſion and acknowledgement thereof.</p>
                  <p>Some others take them to be as it were a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iuſtifying faith, by the nature of it, for it is ſuch a faith as continually increaſeth, and gathereth new

Now this expoſition ſtanding, vtterly ouerthrowes this fond deuiſe; for if iuſtification be wholly abſolued by faith, then haue workes no place at all in iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but how euer this expoſition may be controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, their diſtinction was vtterly vnknowne vnto the Apoſtles, and all the pen-men of ſcripture. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his righteouſnes of good conſcience after the firſt iuſtification, yet acknowledgeth no value in it at all to iuſtifie him<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4.</note>, and counts not onely his workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace, but his beſt deedes, in grace, as dung and droſſe in reſpect of any worth or auaile of them to iuſtification, and it ſhall neuer be diſproued that our Diuines teach, that iuſtification is <hi>actus indiuiduus,</hi> and hath no latitude; the manifeſtation therof to vs is giuen

                  <p>The proofes of this concluſion now followes, and the firſt is taken from a teſtimonie of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk. Cap.</hi> 2.4.

                  <p>But a greater difficultie there is about the fitneſſe of this teſtimonie, to proue the concluſion in hand, for it is apparant that the Prophet ſpeakes of a preſeruation in a temporall iudgement; &amp; what is this to eternall life?

                  <p>The propoſition is not here ſet downe, but eaſily gathered out of the Text: and the truth of it eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced: becauſe the law requires to our iuſtification a perfect and continuall performance of the whole law, and euery part thereof by our ſelues.

                     <hi>The wrath of God.]</hi> It is a queſtion amongſt the learned, whether anger may properly be giuen to God; and many things are ſpoken both wayes: the truth is, that anger as it is in vs, eyther for the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or formall part of it, cannot be giuen to God that is free from all ſuch paſſions and perturbations: yet in a ſenſe it is true that anger is in God: that is, an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and will to puniſh ſinne, ariſing from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſin: and ſo here it is to be vnderſtoode for the diſpleaſure of God conceiued againſt ſinne, teſtified by the puniſhments he inflicts on the tranſgreſſours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is reuealed from heauen.] (viz.)</hi> By thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which out of that his throne of maieſtie, and imperiall ſeate, he executes vpon them that prouoke him.</p>
                  <p>Now the conſequence is eaſily euinced: if there be wrath, there is ſure tranſgreſſion: both from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD that abhorres nothing that he hath made, nor is diſpleaſed at any thing whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is authour, as hee is of all things in the world, except ſinne: if therefore hee be angry with man
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17336:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſure it is becauſe man hath ſinned: ſecondly, his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice permits not to puniſh the guiltleſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.7.8.</p>

                  <p>But let vs conſider briefely their reaſons. Firſt, they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17336:67"/> ſay Angels that are ſpirits alſo and inuiſible, yet were lawfully pictured in the olde Teſtament. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, there was an expreſſe warrant giuen to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> whereas they were expreſſely forbidden to make any image or repreſentation of the Lord: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, graunt that there may be ſome libertie taken herein (as what dare not Painters, and Poets?) yet how vnequall this reaſon is, appeares by that great inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and diſproportion betwixt Angels that are finite creatures, and God which is of infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible maieſtie.</p>
                  <p>And whereas they alleadge, that the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in viſible ſhapes. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, that they vvere not ſhapes of his eſſence, but pledges of his preſence; neither was it Gods purpoſe thereby to teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what an one hee was in his nature or properties; but onely to teſtifie, and euidence that he was now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them: Secondly, beſides that, how will they proue that it is lawfull for vs to picture God in thoſe images and ſhapes wherein hee hath appeared vnto men?</p>
                  <p>Neither is their third reaſon though more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet any whit more forcible: The ſcripture they ſay attributes vnto God all the members of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: And why may we not reſemble him in a picture, as God hath as it were painted out himſelfe in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though other anſweres be giuen by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yet this is that I take ſureſt to reſt in; Gods will to the contrarie, and his flat prohibition, and that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſufficient to all ſuch plauſible why nots? made by the wiſedome of fleſh. What though the Lord deſcending to our capacitie thus pleaſe to ſpeake? ſhall we therefore preſume thus to picture? hauing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe prohibition, with a reaſon; <hi>the voice was heard but no ſhape ſeene. Deut.</hi> 4.5.16.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:17336:68"/>
                  <p>Their fourth reaſon is this; that man may be pictured, and his image drawne; therefore God alſo whoſe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage man is; for the image of the image, is the image of the exemplar, and firſt patterne. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That man as he is the image of God cannot be pictured; for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is man an image of God? in the lineaments of his bodie? Let Papiſts leaue that dreame to the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Anthropomorphites. But he is the image of God, in regard hee pertakes analogically in holineſſe,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4 24.</note> and true righteouſneſſe, which though it ſpread it ſelfe ouer body and ſoule, yet cannot be ſeene otherwiſe then by effects in eyther.</p>
                  <p>The laſt reaſon artificiall is drawne, from the many profits that ſuch images ſerue for: as inſtruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, deuotion, reſtraining of wandering ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Where marke the quickneſſe of an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters ſent,<note place="margin">Hab. 2.18. Iſay 44.9.</note> that hath ſmelt out ſo many great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of thoſe things, that the Lord thought, and taught to be vtterly vnprofitable.</p>
                  <p>But for more particular anſwere to this argument, how will they euer be able to proue this, which muſt be the propoſition of their ſyllogiſme: that whatſoeuer may be a meane of inſtruction, admonition, deuotion, &amp;c. may be vſed as helpes to theſe ends: when as God hath tyed vs to thoſe meanes onely which himſelfe hath ſanctified to this end: and hath giuen Chriſt to be the onely doctour of the Church, and hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs ſufficiently of meanes to theſe ends by the great booke of the creatures, booke of the ſcriptures, viſible word of the ſacraments, inward teaching of his ſpirit: ſecondly, how was it that when theſe were ſuch excellent meanes of teaching, the Lord denied them to the Iewes? and how fals it, that the people ſet to ſchoole to theſe teachers are found moſt ignorant of Gods nature and will? thirdly, what teach they, but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17336:68"/> lying, and falſhood? as lamentable experience ſheweth: what groſſe conceipts of the Deitie theſe doctours haue filled our peoples mindes withall. And leſt they ſay this hath come to paſſe by defect of other teaching by their miniſters. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That may well be in part; but yet ſuch groſeneſſe comes principally from the image; and this alſo their inexpiable ſinne, that haue giuen them teachers no better then images; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more of true paſtors, then their images haue of the Deitie. But enough of this popiſh deuiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, come to ourſelues, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> and let vs be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to take heede how in our very mindes we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any likeneſſe, or image of God. It is true of this Law alſo, that it is ſpirituall, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. and forbids not onely corporall, but euen mentall reſemblances, or ſimilitudes of the Godhead, conceiued by the mind;<note place="margin">Acts 17.29.</note> we may not ſo much as thinke God like to any thing that we ſee or can conceiue.</p>
                  <p>And the beſt way to conceiue God, is as an Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diuine well teacheth, <hi>viâ negationis,</hi> by way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And he that can moſt abſtract God from like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, hath beſt learnt to conceiue GOD, ſuch as he is.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we now vnto the encreaſe of the Gentiles ſinne. <hi>And worſhipped and ſerued the creature,</hi> &amp;c. This, though I know it may be verified of the Gentils in reſpect of their idolatrous worſhip of the Sunne, Moone, &amp;c. and other viſible creatures; yet I take it, is here to be vnderſtood of the worſhip giuen by them to their images.</p>
                  <p>To make way to the doctrine, this queſtion ſhall be propounded; whether the Gentiles gaue vnto their Images Diuine worſhip? or whether their vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had the terme in the images without reference to the prototypa, the things which their images repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17336:69"/> Papiſts gladly lay hold on the affirmatiue part, that they may put difference betwixt theirs and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolatry committed with images. And this, they ſay is that worſhipping of an image, which the ſecond commandement condemnes, namely the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping it as God.</p>
                  <p>Now for anſwere, know we that if wee ſpeake of the rude multitude, whom God had principally blinded, no doubt, but they many of them intended their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the images, wherein they thought ſome Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and diuine power to dwell, and what maruell, that men ſhould grow ſo ſottiſh, when God giues vp to blindneſſe? <hi>Iſay</hi> 44 18.19.20. But for the learneder, and wiſer ſort of them, they knew well enough that they were no Gods, neither did their worſhip ſtay in the image, but was referred to the thing thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, as <hi>Auguſtine, Lactantius, Ambroſe,</hi> &amp; others ſhew; and as Plutarch, <hi>de Iſide &amp; Oſir.</hi> and other of the heathen profeſſed. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. thus brings in an heathen, ſpeaking for himſelfe: <hi>I do not worſhip that ſtone, or that image which is without ſenſe, but I adore that which I ſee, and ſerue him whom I ſee not, who is that? The inuiſible diuine power that is preſident of the Image.</hi> Many ſuch teſtimonies might be produced.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be replyed, that the ſcripture imputes vnto them this groſſeneſſe: <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſcripture ſpeaks generally, not of their intention, but of the euent, as amongſt other places that one. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently euinceth. The things which the Gentiles offered, they offered not to God. but to diuels; not that they intended their ſacrifices to the honour of diuels, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was indeed, in the euent, an honouring of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe ſuggeſtions they rather followed then the will of God. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.19. the Iſraelites are ſaid to haue worſhipped the molten image, not that their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17336:69"/> intention reſted in the Image, as <hi>Exodus</hi> 32.5. but becauſe all this worſhip intended to be conueied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by the image, fell backe vpon the image; God vtterly reiecting ſuch a worſhip from acceptance, which he had ſo oft forbidden by his precept.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſenſe ſtanding (as I ſee not how it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the rule of faith, or is impertinent to the Text) affords this obſeruation.</p>
                  <p>That the worſhip intended to God by an image, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                     </label> is not the worſhip of God, but of the image. That indeed is honoured. but God diſhonoured, whoſe will is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by altered, and his precept violated. Confer 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4 5. vnderſtand this, as before, not of the intention of the worſhipper, but of the euent. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                     </label> 
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then are the Papiſts iuſtly charged vvith as groſſe Idolatry, as euer the heathen practiſed; that worſhip images of God, and Saints, though not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, yet in the euent with the worſhip due to God alone.</p>
                  <p>Many large diſputes, and queries they haue concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the kinde, and degree of worſhip that is due to holy images: ſome of them reſoluing foole wiſely, that images are to be worſhipped with the ſame worſhip that is due to the preſident; others, thinking that ſome thing to groſſe, concluding, that this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood vnproperly, by way of concomitance onely. It were long to reckon vp all their fooleries in this kinde. Alas, that ſuch wits ſhould be ſo occupied? and that there were not ſome good <hi>Ioſiah</hi> amongſt them, by axes and hammers to put end to ſuch heatheniſh reaſonings. Read <hi>Iſay</hi> 30.22. and thou ſhalt ſee vvhat honour is due to ſuch traſh. Their common excuſe is ſufficiently remoued by that which hath beene ſaid in the former queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Now for their worſhip of Images they haue theſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17336:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> reaſons; firſt, that they are ſignes of holy things, and are for their relation to God to be worſhipped. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But I demaund, by whoſe inſtitution come they to be ſignes of holy things, and what is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this reuelation? if by humane appointment onely, they will neuer be able to proue that man can giue to any thing ſuch a reuelation, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a ſigne, thus to ſignifie a holy thing, or to binde vs to ſuch reuerence of ſignes by man ordayned. And for diuine inſtitution, which alone hath power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate ſignes to ſuch holy ſignifications, when they ſhall ſhew it vs out of the ſcriptures, we will entertaine their images with that reuerent eſteeme, and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in vſing, as is due to ſuch ordinances, but yet will euer be far from religious adoration of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they affirme that God by images hath wrought miracles, therby to procure honor vnto them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whether God wrought miracles to procure them honour, or the diuell maruels to delude Idolaters, is hard for Papiſts to determine.</p>
                  <p>But firſt we anſwere that they were <hi>mira non miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> maruels not miracles many of them, that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be wrought, at or by them: ſtrange things perhaps many, that filled the poore people with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment, whilſt they knew not the cunning and power of Sathan.</p>
                  <p>Secondly if miracles, yet not to procure them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but to proue our obedience, did the Lord permit them. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.2.3. miracles are not alwayes ſeales of truth; but ſometimes trials of loyaltie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they reaſon a <hi>pari,</hi> or <hi>ſimili:</hi> man is worthy of veneration becauſe he is the image of God; therfore other images alſo becauſe they are images of Chriſt, or Saints, &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwere; that images made by man to repreſent God, or his Chriſt, are but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocally
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17336:70"/> called images of God and Chriſt. Indeed we honour man as the image of God with ciuill honour, becauſe God hath ſo commanded vs: ſecondly, and hath giuen to men venerable gifts of holineſſe, and righteouſnes, that make them honourable; and when they can ſhew eyther GOD to command worſhip of their images, or demonſtrate ſuch charecters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine excellencies in them as GOD hath placed in man, wee will alſo giue them their due reuerence.</p>
                  <p>Their fourth argument is, <hi>à paribus in contrarijs.</hi> Images are capable of infamie, and reproach, therefore alſo of honour, and worſhip; which argument ſome vtter thus, the contempt done to the image of GOD and his Chriſt redounds to God, and Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the honour done to their images is done to them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Diuines fitly anſwere that it followes not: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are thoſe contraries <hi>paria:</hi> for it ſufficeth to the diſhonouring of God that there be an euill affection, or intention; but a good intention is not ſufficient to the honouring of God, except the meanes as well as the meaning be preſcribed of God.</p>
                  <p>Their other arguments are friuolous, and not worth the naming: for what is it to preſcribe in errour? And what though euill men haue oppugned images, and good men reuerenced them? for neither did the one oppugne, as they were euill; neither were the other good ſo farre as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hey defended them. That laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the infortunate end of thoſe that haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the happineſſe of thoſe that haue maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, hath an apparent miſtaking of no cauſe for a cauſe; for neither were theſe plagued for oppoſing, nor thoſe bleſſed for maintaining images.</p>
                  <p>Now I conclude this whole place with that ſaying of <hi>Lactantius de origin: error. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. where hauing at large diſputed againſt the folly of Image-making, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17336:71"/> worſhip, he concludes: <hi>Fooliſh men as they are, they conſider not nor vnderſtand, that if their images had ſenſe, or motion, they would of their owne accord worſhip men by whom they were poliſhed; which, had they not beene faſhioned and brought into ſhape by man, had ſtill been ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incult and horride ſtones, or vnſhapen and rude matter.</hi>

                     </label> One other thing onely will I obſerue in this text and ſo proceed to that that followeth: And that is the ordinarie connexion of theſe two ſinnes, the making, and worſhipping of an image. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.19. &amp;c. partly through that bewitching which is in them when they are clad as it were with Diuine repreſentations: partly through Gods iuſt iudgement, giuing men ouer to blind dotage, becauſe of their firſt declining from his will.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> And it iuſtifieth the practiſe of Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that to preuent occaſions of Idolatrie, haue remoued them out of our Temples; I hope, neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be reſtored: many exclamations, and bitter inuectiues they haue heard from Idolatrous mouthes; but who knowes not but the Lord hath done them good for that euill? And how vnmeete ſuch contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies are for them that cry out of vs, for lacke of loue to Chriſt, becauſe wee cannot indure the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous abuſe of his image, when themſelues are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the bloud of Saints, Gods liuely images, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man may iudge. Loue to Chriſt is beſt euidenced, by loue to his ordinances, and his Saints, and by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of thoſe things which God profeſſeth to hate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which are eſpecially lying images.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall wee heare their reaſons why they muſt be placed in our temples; forſooth <hi>Salomon</hi> erected Cherubims in the temple. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yet placed he them out of the ſight of the people, in the holy of holies: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had Gods ſpeciall warrant.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:17336:71"/>
                  <p>Secondly, they reaſon from conueniencie; vvhat meeter places for holy images, then holy places? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they are an ornament to the Temple, and withall a meane to keepe our mindes from vaine by-thoughts, and wandering imaginations. <hi>Anſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt: if they were indeed holy by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance it were ſomewhat: But now being but as they are mens deuiſes, and found in-experience to be occaſions of Idolatrie, what more vnmeet place then the Temple for an Image? whereas the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of the place wins it too much eſteeme with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious mindes.</p>

                  <p>That which is in good things hath three degrees: firſt, deprauing of a good action by ſuppoſing a ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter intention.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, leſſening the graces, and commendable parts of others; to diminiſh our owne is humilitie; but to clip anothers due praiſe is enuie. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.2.3.4. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, deniall of thoſe good things wee know to be in another, loue willingly takes notice of the leaſt; and grace will hunt after occaſions to praiſe God in his gifts beſtowed on others.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of euils; that alſo hath three branches: firſt, publiſhing their ſecret ſlips, which in charitie we ought to conceale, and that, eyther without all men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their vertues; or elſe with commemoration of other their good parts, and pretenſe of ſorrow for their faults; in this or the like manner, a man of good parts, faire conditioned, kinde to his friend; it is pittie on him he hath his fault, ſomething coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by increaſing, and making their euils worſe then they are, beames of motes, mountaines of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17336:85"/> mole-hils: humilitie aggrauates its owne ſinnes, to magnifie Gods mercie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.14.15. but charitie leſſeneth the ſinnes of others, by all circumſtances, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Reaſons againſt it: firſt, the detriment it brings is great, robbing a man of the chiefe treaſure, a good name, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22 1. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſcarcely admits any ſound reſtitution; crimes euen vniuſt euer leauing a skarre vpon our good name.</p>

Now though I diſlike not the iudgement of the new, knowing that words paſſiue are ſometimes actiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And ſpecially conſidering that the Apoſtle here entendeth a Catalogue of the Gentiles ſinnes; yet it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſpeake in a word or two of the proper ſignification of the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hated of God.]</hi> Gods hatred is of two ſorts, eternall before time including theſe two actes: firſt, a purpoſe not to ſhew kindneſſe: ſecondly, a deſigning to euill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 11. Temporall in time; and is nothing but the diſlike, and deteſtation of men in reſpect of their ſins. Euidenced by theſe ſignes: firſt, deniall of ſauing grace and meanes thereof.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, not bleſſing meanes vnto them: <hi>Iſay</hi> 6. Thirdly, depriuall euen of common graces, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the power of Sathan, and ſeruing of a mans owne corrupt heart. Fourthly, inflicting of temporall plagues, as curſes, and beginnings of eternall woe after to be inflicted.</p>
                  <p>Taking it actiuely it implyes that hatred that men

To which their anſwere is, that God apprehended in his eſſence, or immanent actions, or gracious properties is not hated of any. But appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as a iudge, and auenger of diſobedience ſo he is hated of prophane vngodly men.</p>
                  <p>Signes of it beſt aſſigned by the contrarie tokens of loue; for it is true hee that is not with God, is againſt him; he that loues him not, hates him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, not to loue his preſence, eyther in the heart by his ſpirit, or in the congregation by his word, or in his comming to iudgement.</p>

But briefely it ſhall ſuffice to ſpeake of the ſeuerall kindes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of doing wrong, which though they may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to all kinde of wrongs, yet ſhew themſelues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in wrongs done in reſpect of temporall goods.

                  <p>This imperfect rule of life vouchſafed vnto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is commonly called the law of nature.

                  <p>Here therefore it ſhall not be amiſſe, once for all to ſhew what the law of nature is, and how it differs from the law written.</p>
                  <p>The law of nature, is that rule of pietie, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, that the Lord hath written in the hearts of all men: whereby they know confuſedly, and in generall, what is good; what is euill; what to be done; what to be forborn.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:17336:91"/>
                  <p>It differs from the law written, not in ſubſtance; they being all one; but firſt, in the meaſure: ſecondly, in the manner, and meanes of reuelation: for vvhat the written law reueales diſtinctly, and particularly; that the law of nature teacheth confuſedly only, &amp; in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Firſt, that God is to be worſhipped the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reueales; but how to be worſhipped diſtinctly it reueales not: ſecondly, the manner of reuealing is not all one: for the one had certaine, and immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation from God; and afterwards was deliuered by the ſame GOD in writing; the other was knowne onely by a generall light ſet in the ſoule in creation. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9.</p>

But for eternall death it ſeemes more doubtfull, yet this is euident, that they knew another life, and death af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this; as appeares both by their Eliſian fields, and their hell, which they write of; as alſo by the terrours of conſcience that they were filled vvithall euen where humane lawes tooke no hold of them. And howſoeuer perhaps they thought with Papiſts, that euerie ſinne deſerued not hell; yet for the groſſe acts of notorious ſinnes, it was their perſwaſion, that hell torments vvere due vnto them.

And as touching the Gentiles tranſgreſſion, hee firſt proues it, ranging them into theſe two ranckes.</p>

                  <p>The concluſion then of this place is this: that the very maſters of manners and chiefe controulers of other mens ſinnes, amongſt the Gentiles are inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God, and liable to condemnation, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.

                  <p>And as the reaſon here giuen is forcible, ſo are there other in Scripture very effectuall: as firſt, that a guiltie conſcience hinders the right and couragious exerciſe of admonition and correction: and it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that <hi>Iethro</hi> requiring courage in Magiſtrates, requires alſo that they be ſuch as feare GOD, and carefull to depart from euill<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 18.21.</note>, and the Lord before he ſends <hi>Iſay</hi> to denounce iudgements againſt the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, firſt purgeth him from his owne ſinnes<note n="n" place="margin">Iſay 6.7.</note>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeede, hee can neuer as he ought, reproue or correct that in another, whereof himſelfe is guilty<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 8.7.9.</note>.

How fondly? for firſt, weigh the antitheſis, how is death called the wages or ſtipend of ſinne? is it not becauſe it is giuen as a reward due to the merit of ſinne? and how ſhall the Antitheſis intended hold? except we ſay, that eternall life is giuen, not as wages due to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  <p>Our ſecond reaſon, is from the requiſite conditions of meritorious good workes, which are theſe: firſt, a proportion betwixt the perſon meriting, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him, at whoſe hands we can merit; and in deed what obligation can there be wrought, by the worke of a creature, to binde the Creator to recompence? and it is truely ſaid, that the obedience of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, could not haue merited at the hands of God, had hee not beene, in reſpect of his Diuine perſon equal vnto his Father<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 9.14. 1 Ioh. 1.7.</note>, and howſoeuer, if we had ſtoode in ſtate of innocencie, and obedience, eternall glorie ſhould haue beene recompenced vnto vs, yet could it not haue beene challenged, as due by merit, but as by Couenant and promiſe freely made by God.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, that they be our owne, wrought by our owne ſtrength, not by power miniſtred by him that rewardeth.</p>

I might be infinite in this kinde, but abſtaine purpoſely from prolixnie. Heare we now the reaſons brought by our aduerſaries to ſtabliſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of good workes, done in grace.</p>
                  <p>The Text now in hand, is as oft, as any alleadged; whence they muſt thus reaſon; if GOD ſhall reward euery man according to his workes, giuing to thoſe which continue in well doing, eternall life, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. then are good workes meritorious of eternall life; but the firſt is true, therefore the ſecond alſo. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is not good; for though GOD giue eternall life, to thoſe that continue in well doing, yet followes it not, that well doing deſerues eternall life: neither doth this place intimate the cauſe for which eternall life is giuen, but the qualification of the perſons that ſhall haue admittance into eternall life; which breefe anſwere well weighed, brings much light to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie; for indeed the queſtion is not, whether men continuing in well doing ſhall haue eternall life; which we grant, but whether ſuch as are ſaued, are ſaued for the merit of their well doing. And in this whole que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, there is a double enquirie to be attended: firſt, of the ſubiect or perſons, to whom eternall life is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; as alſo of their qualification; to which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

But whoſoeuer hee is, Iew or Gentile, male or female, poore or rich, bond or free, that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſſe is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him<note n="s" place="margin">Acts 10.34.</note>: and whoſoeuer workes euill, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partialitie puniſhed, <hi>Iob.</hi> 34.19.</p>

                  <p>For the generall nature, it is commonly enquired, whether it be an act habite, or power of the ſoule: that it is not a bare act appeares, becauſe ſundry actions are giuen vnto it; as to teſtifie, accuſe, excuſe, acquit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne; as alſo becauſe it can neuer be loſt. That it is not habite, appeares alſo, becauſe it is borne with vs, it remaines therefore, that it is a power or faculty of the ſoule.</p>

                  <p>Dependent vpon theſe actions, are others: as firſt, in euill, accuſation: &amp;c. that is, a continuall laying off our ſinnes to our charge, as it is ſaid of <hi>Dauid,</hi> after num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the people<note n="y" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.10.</note>, and after the cutting off the lappe of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, that his heart ſmote him; that is, his conſcience accuſed him, told him he had done euil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, condemnation<note n="z" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.20.</note>, by applying the curſe of the law to the ſoule of the delinquent, in the like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall ſyllogiſme as before.</p>
                  <p>The conſequents wherof, are feare and trembling<note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 2.</note>: griefe and ſadneſſe<note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 5.</note>: deſperation, &amp;c. as in <hi>Cain, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:17336:128"/>
                  <p>In good duties or innocencie, excuſing or clearing of our ſelues from guilt; &amp; ſo abſoluing from puniſhment. Whence followes comfort in the ſoule, ioy, boldnes to come into Gods preſence, euen in the midſt of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="c" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.21.</note>: &amp; theſe are the actions &amp; offices of conſcience: and we haue ſeene the manner how it performes them.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> The vſe of all is this; firſt, that we therefore feare to wound conſcience, or to ſin againſt it: we need no other accuſer, iudge or tormentor; it is all theſe to a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that vve hereby encourage our ſelues in vvel-doing, though we ſee no outward acceptance, or encouragement afforded vs by men: an excuſing and peaceable conſcience is comfort aboundant to a child of God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Proceede wee a little farther; there are accident to conſcience in the performing of theſe offices of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, two things: firſt, errour: ſecondly, ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing there from. Errour hath place both in things to be done, and in things done: ſcruple eſpecially in things deliberated, and not yet performed.</p>
                  <p>Error of conſcience in both kindes, is of two ſorts: it erres two waies; either by a falſe aſſumption, the <hi>Synte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſis</hi> being corrupted, or by falſe applying of true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>By a falſe aſſumption; as when a man miſtakes good for euill, or euill for good; that is, thinkes that good which is euill, or that euil which is good: by which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking, it comes to paſſe, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience reſolues, where it ſhould reſtraine; reſtraines, where it ſhould reſolue; condemnes, where it ſhould acquite; acquites, where it ſhould condemne. <hi>Exemp. It ſhal come to paſſe, that he that killeth you ſhal think, that he doth God good ſeruice</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 16.2.</note>: that is, hauing his iudgement blinded, taking euil for good, his conſcience ſhall cleare, acquit, comfort him, euen where if iudgement were not erroneous, it would condemne him: examples of this kinde of erroneous conſcience
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17336:128"/> are frequent amongſt our people: ſo ſee we many pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing vſurie, without any remurmuration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, through errour of iudgement, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond manner of conſcience erring, is by falſe application of true principles; inſtance wherof ſchoole-diuines make this: this principle is true; that GOD is aboue all, and onely to be beloued: here is the errour of conſcience, when it concludes from this true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple miſinterpreted, that therefore our neighbour is not to be beloued: againe, that thankſgiuing is part of Gods worſhip; therfore no thankes to be giuen to men, as inſtruments of Gods bleſſings vnto vs; and of this kind of erroneous conſcience, the world is full: Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are lawfull; a true principle: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this recreation, ſuppoſe cardes and dice in this meaſure, at this time, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; here is the errour. Religious adoration is not to be giuen to creatures; a true principle; therefore wee may not kneele in the act of receiuing the Sacrament; an erroneous concluſion. Chriſtians haue libertie in things indifferent; a true principle; therefore not bound to obay Magiſtrates in things indifferent: an erroneous application. Oſtentation to be auoided in prayers; a true principle; therefore wee may not pray with our families; an erroneous concluſion, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Cauſes of theſe errours aſſigned are theſe: firſt, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, eyther vniuerſall or particular: ſecondly, neglect of meanes of reformation: thirdly, ſelfe-loue, fourthly, pride, and that which <hi>Peter</hi> cals ſinging our owne ſong, and a diſdaine to yeeld to the iudgement of men better enformed.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſſe from this place, it ſhall not be amiſſe to propound that vſuall queſtion; whether, and how farre erroneous conſcience bindes, for explanation. <hi>Exempl.</hi> A man through errour of iudgement, is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it is a neceſſarie part of Gods worſhip to be preſent at a Maſſe; the queſtion is, whether that man
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17336:129"/> be bound in conſcience to be preſent at a Maſſe, ſo that the omiſſion thereof, ſhall lay guilt of ſinne vpon his conſcience; or thus, a man is perſwaded in iudgement, that to kneele at the Communion, is a kinde of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and vtterly vnlawfull; it is demaunded whether a man hauing this ſetled perſwaſion, be bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from kneeling; and whether kneeling, hee lay guilt of ſinne vpon his conſcience; or thus, a Papiſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing amongſt vs is perſwaded, that it is vtterly vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be preſent at our Church ſeruice; the queſtion is whether he be bound in conſcience to abſtaine from our congregation; ſo that if hee be there preſent, hee ſhall ſinne againſt God? <hi>Anſ.</hi> For diſtinct anſwere to this intricate queſtion; we muſt diſtinguiſh of things whereabout the errour is: they are eyther ſuch as are ſimply commanded, or ſecondly, ſimply forbidden, or thirdly, of indifferent nature, betwixt both: ſimply neyther commanded, nor forbidden.</p>
                  <p>Now if the queſtion be touching the ſetled errour of iudgement in things ſimply commanded, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; the anſwere, as I iudge, is this: that the omitting of a thing forbidden of God erroneouſlie iudged law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be done, is a ſin in the omitter <hi>interpretatiue,</hi> as the ſchooles ſpeake; and yet ſecondly, the conſcience is not bound to doe the things ſo erroneouſly iudged lawfull;<note place="margin">Hieron. ab Hang. in moral.</note> and I iudge hereof with an auncient ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that there is much difference betwixt theſe two propoſitions in this caſe; the conſcience ſuggeſting that an Idoll is to be worſhipped; to ſay the partie, during that errour of iudgement and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of conſcience not worſhipping the Idoll, ſinnes: and to ſay, that while that ſuggeſtion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience continues, hee is bound to worſhip the Idoll: the firſt propoſition is true; the ſecond falſe; Reaſon of the firſt propoſition is, becauſe according to ſuch a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17336:129"/> mans iudgement, that was a dutie, and therefore neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof may be reduced to lack of feare of GOD. Reaſon of the ſecond this; becauſe erroneous conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence abſolues not from Gods precept, which bindeth, not to commit Idolatry: more plainely thus; it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vnto ſinne, to doe againſt conſcience; it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not vnto dutie, to doe according to conſcience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the conſcience be ruled by the word of God; the ſame is to be holden of the ſecond inſtance, and the like; where the conſcience erres in iudging that vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which is a commanded dutie; he ſhall ſinne, that iudging it vnlawfull to come to our churches, yet comes; becauſe he doth that which he iudgeth to be a ſinne yet will it not follow, that hee is bound not to come; for the error of conſcience cannot diſpenſe with the bond of Gods precept.</p>
                  <p>So then you wil ſay, not doing or doing in ſuch a caſe he ſinnes: true, but yet here is no abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie; for there is a third thing required; that is, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere erronea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſcientiam,</hi> &amp; that is the remedy in ſuch caſes; labour to be better informed, that thou mayeſt free thy ſelfe from this dangerous neceſſitie of ſinning.</p>
                  <p>As touching errour about things indifferent, the caſe is ſomething different; while a man iudgeth of a thing indifferent that it is vnlawfull; for during ſuch iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both he ſhall ſinne in doing that which hee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnlawfull, and ſecondly he is bound not to doe it: becauſe the Lord hath commaunded touching things indifferent, that they ſhall not be done with doubting<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note>, much leſſe where the iudgement is fully perſwaded of their vnlawfulnes: and thus much of the ſetled errour of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond accident befalling conſcience, is ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe ariſing from ſome errour, or ignorance more or leſſe in the iudgement, and it differs thus from that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17336:130"/> other conſcience commonly called erroneous; for that there is a iudgement and reſolution paſſed (though er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 14.14.</note>) here, no iudgement paſſed eyther way, but a deſceptation and debate in the minde, whether the thing to be done, be lawfull or not. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</p>
                  <p>And of this there are degrees: firſt, where the minde hangs in <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>quilibrie,</hi> as it were, in euen poyſe, inclining nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, which is called ambiguitie: ſecondly, where the minde is inclined more one way, then the other, yet not fully reſolued; and is called ſuſpition, more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coniecture.</p>
                  <p>Cauſes of it as of the other; ignorance eſpecially particular: ſecondly, a <hi>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ium,</hi> as ſome terme it, of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humilitie and feare.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this ſtate of the minde and conſcience, it is vſually demanded in things indifferent whether du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſcruple, the thing doubted of may be done. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I take it no; for the Apoſtle affirmes that <hi>what ſo euer is not of faith is ſinne. Rom.</hi> 14.23.</p>
                  <p>What then is the courſe to be holden in ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſcience? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is the principall: make conſcience to vſe the meanes of reſolution; ſuch as are conference, ſtudie, &amp;c. without preiudice, and with ſincere deſire to be rightly enformed, and humble purpoſe to yeeld to the truth once euidenced; prayer vnto God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For abſoluing of this place, this queſtion ſhall be propounded; whether in caſe of ſuch errour, and ſcruple of conſcience, the Magiſtrate may vrge to doe things lawfull, contrarie to iudgement whereof vvee are not yet throughly reſolued. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I take it yes; with theſe cautions: firſt, that there be care taken for better information, of the erring, and for reſolution of the doubting conſcience: ſecondly, that aduice that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> once gaue, is not to be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17336:130"/> omitted; that <hi>ſcrupuloſi</hi> be not too hardly dealt withall: thirdly, that puniſhment and compulſion be not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, ſo long as there appeares a deſire and godly endeauour to be better informed: theſe ſpecially in things indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Whether ſinnes a man in abſtaining from acting an indifferent thing, lawfully commanded by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, during his ſcruple? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, for his ſcruple frees him not from the obligation of Gods precept, touching obedience to the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>And ſhould he alſo ſinne, if during his ſcruple hee ſhould do it? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. theſe three conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions pertinent to this purpoſe, let them be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>A man doing or abſtaining from any action, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the dictate of erroneous conſcience, ſinnes: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe God hath commanded that we goe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience.</p>
                  <p>A man doing or abſtaining according to erroneous conſcience, as erroneous, is not free from ſinne; nay ſinneth, becauſe GOD hath no where commanded or warranted to doe according to conſcience ſimply: but with this ſuppoſition, that conſcience be rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the word of God, and as was before ſaid, the errour of conſcience diſpenſeth not with obedience to Gods law.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in ſuch caſe there lyeth a bond vpon the conſcience, to free it ſelfe from errour, wherewith it is intangled: and continuance of errour through neglect of meanes of better information, is cenſurable of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now the vſe which we make of all this now ſpoken, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                     </label> is this: that therefore we be diligent, by all meanes, to informe our iudgements, touching all actions of life: great is the force of conſcience both wayes, either to comfort if thou do well, or to caſt downe, if ill: ſecondly;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17336:131"/> there is nothing that thou canſt do wel, whiles thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is polluted, or erreth, or doubteth<note n="g" place="margin">Tit. 1.15. Rom. 14.23.</note>. Thirdly, conſcience erring may excuſe but vainely, terrifie need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely, and would God in theſe ſcrupulous times, this care of right information, might be conſcionably vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; perhaps the peace of our Church might be more, and without all doubt the peace of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences would be farre more ſolide; and that diſtaſte of conference for information, vpon preiudice and too much ſtiffeneſſe in our owne opinions, how continues it the maime of our Church? and robs the people of much of their comfort? Beloued, I blame not any for abſtayning while ſcruple laſteth; but this is that I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pray in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſus, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: that conferences of things now controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed may more conſcionably be endeauoured, and leſſe ſcornefully reiected. In things ſubſtantiall, I loue reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedneſſe: in matters of leſſe importance thus I am min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and I thinke with warrant; not ſo to reſolue, but as willing to change ſentence when better reaſon ſhall ſway mee.</p>
                  <p>Proceede we now breefely to the laſt thing in this common place; that is the kindes or diuiſions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; which are diuerſly aſſigned: firſt, according to the light that directs it, thus: one directed by principles naturall, which they call naturall conſcience; another inlightened with the knowledge of the ſcripture, and by it directed in all his functions. Of naturall, and as vvee may tearme it, heatheniſh conſcience, this ſcripture now in hand treateth; vvhoſe light (though imperfect,) directs notwithſtanding to do ſome duties; &amp; reſtraines from ſome ſinnes, as we ſee by thoſe many vvholeſome lawes made by them againſt periury, murder, whordom, &amp;c. and thoſe terrours, tearmed by their poets, furies, wherwith in groſſe ſins, their conſcience was poſſeſſed.</p>

                  <p>Conſcience Chriſtian, hath, beſides this diuine light of nature that other cleare light of the ſcriptures to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and guide it; whoſe guidance is more large and more diſtinct, then that which heatheniſh conſcience had: theſe things might be profitablie preſſed further, but I feare I haue beene alreadie too long in them. <hi>Bernard</hi> (if that Treatie of conſcience be his) makes foure ſorts of conſcience, firſt, <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of euill quiet conſcience are three ſorts; firſt, the large conſcience, that ſwallowes ſmall ſinnes (as they are termed) without ſcruple or remurmura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſtirres onely in groſſe enormities; trembles at murther, pleaſeth it ſelfe in raſh anger: reſtraines from great oathes, by wounds blood, &amp;c. makes no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe by faith, troth, bread, fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Third the ſeared or brawnie conſcience that in life and death, proſperitie and aduerſitie,<note n="i" place="margin">Epheſ. 4.18. 1 Tim. 4 12.</note> is ſenſeleſſe as a ſtone; as is ſaid of <hi>Naball</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam 25.37.</note>. I ſpare the large handling of theſe particulars; reaſons or cauſes of this euill quiet conſcience, theſe: firſt, ignorance<note n="l" place="margin">Epheſ. 4.18.</note>, ſecondly, errour<note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 16.2.</note>, thirdly, commonnes of ſin, when it is growne into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; thus it is thought, the Patriarches ſwallowed vp their Polygamie, fourthly, cuſtome of ſinne, fiftly, want of a ſound and faithfull miniſterie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24.25.</p>
                  <p>But hence are theſe two conſectaries; firſt, that euery quiet conſcience is not preſentlie a good conſcience, becauſe quiet: for euen euill conſcience may be at peace;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17336:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> and many proclaime their miſerie and ſhame, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in groſſe ſinnes, thanke God they were neuer troubled in conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that therefore the not ſtirring or recoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the conſcience, is no good rule to walke by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond kinde of euill conſcience is the ſtirring or troubled euill conſcience; which alſo hath three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: firſt, which ſtirres in ſmall things, ſwallowes vp greater in ſilence,<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 23.24.</note> grudgeth at breaking the fridayes faſt, at fleſh in Lent, but at no time ſtickes at ſtrange fleſh. This generally popiſh Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, which accuſeth and terrifieth for doing good, or omitting euill, through errour of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that too ſorely accuſeth, though rightly, as in <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Iudas, Mat.</hi> 27.3 4.5.</p>
                  <p>To remedie the iuſt terrour of the conſcience this doe: firſt; humble thy ſelfe vnder the mightie hand of GOD, acknowledging thy guiltineſſe<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 32.3.4.5.</note>: ſecondly, begge earneſtly of the Lord, to haue thy conſcience ſprinckled with the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p>Adde as ſignes of an euill accuſing conſcience theſe: firſt, to flie the ſtroke of the miniſterie<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 3.20.21.</note>, ſecondly, fearefulneſſe and trembling in darkneſſe and ſolitude, euen at the noiſe of a leafe ſhaken<note n="q" place="margin">Iob. 15.21.</note>: thirdly, generall diſquietneſſe in the heart. <hi>Iſay</hi> 57.20.</p>
                  <p>A conſectarie hence is this, that euen ſtirring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not a good conſcience. Followes novv that which we call good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Of good conſcience I here ſpeake, not intending an abſolute goodneſſe; which is none ſince the fall. I know conſcience perfectly, and throughly good, is alwayes ſtirring, yet excuſing and comfortable: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17336:132"/> by <hi>Adams</hi> feareleſſe conuerſing vvith Gods Maieſtie, in time of innocencie: and therefore all that deadneſſe and dulneſſe of conſcience, all accuſations and terrours of conſcience, let them be as ſo many remembrances of our naturall guiltineſſe, and falling from our firſt eſtate.</p>
                  <p>But of conſcience, as it is good in part after rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſo ſpeake I, and ſo would <hi>Bernard</hi> be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: this alſo is of two ſorts, good and quiet, good and troubled; not that the goodneſſe of conſcience ſtands in diſquietneſſe, but that there may be a good conſcience, where there is trouble, and ſome degree of terrour.</p>
                  <p>The good quiet conſcience, is that that rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth in Chriſt Ieſus, vpon priuitie of performing the conditions of remiſſion, faith and repentance, this that <hi>Salomon</hi> cals a continuall feaſt<note n="r" place="margin">Pro. 15.15.</note>, the Iewell of a Chriſtian, and as one well tearmes it, heauen vpon earth.

                  <p>Meanes to obtaine it: firſt, to iudge and condemne our ſelues<note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note>: ſecondly, ſtabliſh faith in Chriſts bloud<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note>: thirdly, deſire in all things to liue honeſtly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18.</p>
                  <p>A good troubled conſcience, is that that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, for the breach of the law, and ſometimes fils the heart with diſquietneſſe; ſee <hi>Dauids</hi> heart ſmiting him<note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.10.</note>: and this I call good, not ſimply, but firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it tends to good in Gods children: ſecondly, for that it is in a meaſure in thoſe that are ſprinkled in their hearts from an euill conſcience<note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 10.22.</note>: thirdly, becauſe there is ſome rectitude in the performance of theſe functions.</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:17336:133"/>
                  <p>This ſtate of the conſcience is felt, euer now and then in ſome meaſure in Gods children; and as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith well, ſome of Gods Saints haue more of the quiet good conſcience; ſome, more of the troubled good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the firſt is the happier, the ſecond the ſtronger, but both righteous. Wouldeſt thou then know whether God be well pleaſed with both? that God that frees one from temptation, ſtrengthens the other in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note>: the one feeles that the Lord is ſweet, the other proues that the Lord is ſtrong; ſtrong in deede and mightie in battaile, wherein though hee ſuffer his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to be preſſed, yet not to be oppreſſed through the multitude of his compaſſions.</p>
                  <p>Notes of goodnes of conſcience ioyned with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: firſt, except in violence or temptation, it holds the principle, yet God is good to Iſraell; as in another caſe <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 73.1.</note>: ſecondly, reſolues, though the Lord kill him, yet to put truſt in him<note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 13.15.</note>, the violence of temptation being ouer-blowne: thirdly, earneſtly ſeekes to God by prayer: fourthly, carefully, and vvith an hungring deſire, hangs on the miniſterie of the word: and no Phiſition more welcome in the deadlieſt ſickneſſe of the bodie, then an interpreter, that one of a thouſand, that declares gods righteouſnes to a man thus troubled<note n="c" place="margin">Iob. 33.23.</note>: fiftly, continues die wayes of Gods commandements, vſually with more ſtrictneſſe, and more zeale, then others leſſe troubled; as <hi>Bernard</hi> well ſaith, the one in ſweetneſſe, the other in ſharpneſſe, runnes the way of Gods commandements.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the nature, offices, accidents, and kindes of conſcience; vvherein, if I ſeeme to haue beene long, conſider in what times we liue: ſecondly, how neceſſarie the knowledge of conſcience is; and for amends of this prolixitie, expect euen compendious breuitie in all that followeth.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:17336:133"/>
                  <p>Now by this that hath been ſpoken, the meaning of the words is explaned; the applying of this verſe to the concluſion, ſee in the <hi>Analyſis;</hi> the thing proued is, that the Gentiles that knew not the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> written, yet knew by nature ſome things of the morall law of God, this proued by two arguments: firſt, their fact in outward doing the things which the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: ſecondly, their conſcience, excuſing in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accuſing in euil: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Coatteſtante. That is, together with their fact; as their fact teſtified their knowledge or the law, ſo their conſcience alſo vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the ſame. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In this period I muſt profeſſe a ſwaruing from the courſe I held in publike handling, as iudging my ſecond thoughts here ſomewhat wiſer; circumciſion I then tooke as a Sacrament, ſealing vp vnto vs the couenant of grace, and conceaued the profitableneſſe of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament here mentioned, to be as of others, a meane to confirme faith; the law alſo I reſtrained to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17336:140"/> of faith and new obedience, to which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments binde vs, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4.</p>
                  <p>But now obſeruing the ſcope of the Apoſtle, mee thinks this expoſition though ſutable enough to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie of Faith, yet fitting not the drift of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>That wee may better iudge of the ſenſe; conſider we a little the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt: which is, as I take it, to take from the Iewes all their vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in circumciſion &amp; ſuch like ceremonious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances in the matter of iuſtification: they obiect circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is profitable to iuſtification: <hi>Paul</hi> yeelds it with a limitation, and a diſtinction as before, not to be long.</p>
                  <p>Conſider we what it is whereto the Apoſtle affirmes circumciſion to be profitable. <hi>Anſ.</hi> to iuſtification in the ſight of GOD: for that is it which the Iewes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion then is, how the Apoſtle could affirme circumciſion to be auaileable to righteouſnes of works in the ſight of God: ſeeing <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. it was inſtituted for a ſigne, and a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Circumciſion is conſidered two wayes; general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as a ceremonie, or a branch of the law ceremoniall; more ſtrictly as a Sacraments as a part of the law, it may truely be ſaid to be auaileable to iuſtification, <hi>pro parte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ua,</hi> as euery part of obedience auailes that way. Now whether in this ſenſe the Apoſtle affirmes it to be auaileable, I dare not determine; how be it this is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where euident, that the Iewes vſed, vrged, truſted more in it as a part of obedience, then as in a ſacrament of the Couenant of grace, reade <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23.</p>
                  <p>Yea, what if we take it as a Sacrament, and ſay that it aſſured euen iuſticiaries of ſaluation by workes, if they could bring ſuch workes as the law required? Surely, all that the Lord requires in both Couenants, is obedience vnto the law: and that is the condition of

                  <p>Now when they come to proue this concluſion, they thus enunciate it, that the Sacraments are true inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſes of grace; which if they would thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane, that the Sacraments are inſtruments or meanes of grace which they are ordayned to confer, <hi>poteſtate:</hi> we would eaſily accord with them; for it is true, that they are not emptie ſignes, but by Gods ordinance haue a fitneſſe, when they light vpon a ſubiect right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſpoſed, to worke that whereto they are ordayned: but to ſay that they are actual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſts ſhold demurre of adminiſtration: muſt the profit needs be conferring of ſanctitie, vvithout their diſpoſition? and not rather their obligation and binding to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience through their whole life? we miniſter rightly to infants of beleeuing parents thereby initiating them into the couenant, binding them to perpetuall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but whether baptiſme any otherwiſe profit them, till they haue diſcretion to make vſe of baptiſme by meditation, to me it is doubtfull.</p>
                  <p>Second argument <hi>ab efficiente,</hi> they are ſignes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſtitution and therefore practicall, and haue power by the worke done, to effect ſome thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17336:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We yeeld all; but yet their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion remaines vnproued; for what though they haue by diuine inſtitution a power to vvorke ſupernaturall effects; yet actually they effect them not without the praeuious diſpoſition of the receiuer.</p>
                  <p>Third argument, Sacraments depend on God in the very vſe, who workes by the miniſter, therefore by the worke done they confer grace. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not: for what though concurrence of the principall agent to be required to make the inſtrument effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? will it follow therefore, that the effect, to vvhich they are deſigned, is vvrought whereſoeuer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is applyed? I take it not: except it be ſhewed, that as the cooperation of the principall is neceſſarie, ſo it is alwayes certaine and preſent; which who can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to be perpetuall in the Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>Fourth argument, Sacraments depend vpon Chriſts death and paſſion, Chriſts death hath giuen a power to Sacraments to worke grace, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> firſt, that Sacraments reſpect Chriſts death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the obiect, then as the efficient: ſecondly, be it graunted, that Chriſt by his death hath procured vnto his children the gifts of the ſpirit, by vvhich Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are effectuall vnto vs? yet vvill it not follow that therefore thy are effectuall to all receauers, in as much as the efficacie of Chriſts merit reacheth not to all, and againe the ſpirit by vvhich they are made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, is not giuen to all. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Fift argument, Sacraments are effectuall to aſſure vs of pardon of ſinnes; therefore are practicall ſignes, that haue a kinde of inherent vertue to confer grace: <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not; the Antecedent is too narrow to inferre ſo large a conſequent. It is true that they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall meanes to aſſure beleeuers in greater meaſure of the pardon of ſinnes; not true, that they are thus
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17336:143"/> effectuall by the very receiuing, to thoſe alſo that are not pre-diſpoſed. And <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſpeech is not to be forgotten; though ſacraments of themſelues be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably effectuall, yet may it come to paſſe that to vs they are not effectuall, in reſpect of our owne indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>Sixt argument, ſacraments reſpect faith, otherwiſe then the word; for the word goes before faith, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments follow it<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. Acts 8.</note>: therefore ſacraments worke their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not by meditation or diſcourſe, but by inherent vertue. <hi>Anſ.</hi> A meere calumney; for what if Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the word be in that reſpect vnlike, that the Word goes before faith, &amp; Sacraments follow it? ſhall it thence follow that Sacraments require not our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to this end that they may be effectuall? or that they conferre grace where is no diſpoſition in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer? Nay, doth not the contrarie hence follow, that for as much as Sacraments may not be adminiſtred but to beleeuers<note n="c" place="margin">Acts. 8.</note>: that therefore they are not effectuall to vs without our prediſpoſition?</p>
                  <p>Seauenth argument, Sacraments are effectuall to the receiuer though miniſtred in an vnknowne tongue; therefore by the worke done. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If by this not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the language, they meane an vniuerſall ignorance of the tenour of the Couenant; ſo we deny their Antecedent: if ſuch an ignorance of the tongue, as that the word of promiſe is vnderſtood by the ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, though not as propounded by the miniſter; ſo their Antecedent infers not the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Eight Argument: if they auaile not, ſaue onely by meditation and vnderſtanding, then were there no cauſe why the learned &amp;c. ſhould be baptiſed. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not, for euen they that vnderſtand may by renewing their meditation in the vſe of the ſeales be confirmed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>

                  <p>Argument the laſt; otherwiſe no difference betwixt ſacraments of new and old teſtament. <hi>Anſ.</hi> We yeeld it in reſpect of efficacie<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1.2.3</note>; though in the ſignes, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſignifying, and ſuch other circumſtances diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be manifold.</p>
                  <p>Many other both teſtimonies and reaſons are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the aduerſaries, which partly for breuitie ſake, partly, becauſe they are not ſo vrgent, nor ſo nearely concerne the queſtion, I haue omitted; if any ſhall ſay that I haue impoſed vpon them a concluſion which they maintaine not. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Eyther this muſt be their concluſion to which their reaſons muſt be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; elſe proue they nothing againſt vs: for wee yeeld them, to be not onely ſignes to ſignifie, but inſtruments effectuall to conferre grace to Gods children in the right vſe of them.</p>

                  <p>And our people may here arme themſelues againſt Anabaptiſticall dreamers; that would nullifie Popiſh Baptiſme, and vrge rebaptization.</p>
                  <p>It is true, they neuer felt fruit of Baptiſme, till they left communion with Rome; but had the ſacrament in it ſelfe entier, and potentially fruitfull to ſeale vp for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe to beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Now if hereſie of the Miniſter impaire not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament, much leſſe ſhall it hinder the office and efficacie of the Sacrament in the heart of the beleeuer, vvhich hangs vvholly vpon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God; and faith of the recipient, wrought by the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>From hereſie let vs paſſe briefely to other lewdneſſe of the Miniſter, and ſee whether the lewd life, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified heart of a Miniſter any whit diminiſh the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſacrament in it ſelfe, or hinder the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie thereof to vs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe queſtions I rather propound, becauſe I ſee they are ſuch as at this day much trouble the church of God. And Lord, that our church were ſo happy as to cut off ſuch ſtumbling blockes from the vveake. It is too true of our Miniſters, many of them, that is ſaid of <hi>Elyes</hi> ſonnes they haue occaſioned the people to abhorre the offerings of the Lord<note n="t" place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note>: I ſay not, but it is the peoples ſinne to abſtaine, yet withall I am ſure it is the heauy ſinne of ſuch Miniſters, that occaſion ſuch abſtinence, from the Lords holy ordinances. To the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Some of the reaſons before alledged may hether be applyed, to proue that the lewdneſſe of the Miniſter, detracts nothing from the ſubſtance or efficacie of the ſacrament.</p>
                  <p>To theſe adde theſe reaſons: firſt, <hi>Iudas</hi> miniſtred baptiſme<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 4.2.</note> ſufficient in it ſelfe, I doubt not alſo but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17336:153"/> effectuall<note n="vv" place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> to the beleeuing ſuſcipient, yet himſelfe a ſecret infidell, yea a diuell incarnate<note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 6.70.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Leuites and Prieſts amongſt the Iewes offered ſacrifices, celebrated Sacraments; vvhich to Gods people were ſeales of the Couenant; meanes to nouriſh faith; yet themſelues many of them vnſanctified men. Thirdly, otherwiſe there could be no aſſurance at all to Gods children that any time they receiued a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; becauſe that ſanctification of the heart, though it muſt be preſumed to be, where the life is but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reformed; yet cannot be knowne certainely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by ſpeciall reuelation. And what difference there is in this behalfe, betwixt a ſecret, and open prophane man; I ſee not. Fourthly, inſtruments haue their effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency from vertue of the principall mouer; neither can the euilnes of the Miniſter fruſtrate the vertue of Gods ordinance, in the making, or working of the ſacrament.</p>

                  <p>As the light of the ſunne is not defiled, though it paſſe through the dirtieſt place, ſo neither the dignitie nor vertue of Sacraments hindered by lewdnes of the miniſter.</p>
                  <p>And therefore though I loath ſuch Miniſters as by their lewd life cauſe Gods people to abhorre the Lords ſacrifices<note n="y" place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note>: yet I cannot ſee, with what comfort the people can refuſe Sacraments for the ill demeanour of the Miniſters. Doth any man refuſe a Kings Donation,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17336:153"/> becauſe a lewd Lawyer drawes vp the conueyance, or deliuers it ſealed in the name of the King?</p>
                  <p>But I haſten to the third branch, which is ignorance; and here thus propound the queſtion; whether the negligence or vnabilitie of the Miniſter to preach, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the ſufficiencie or efficacie of the Sacrament to the beleeuing communicant. This queſtion hath long troubled the Church of God amongſt vs, and yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieteth ſome men weake in iudgement.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh with my heart, our Church were ſo happy as to cut off occaſion of this queſtion, by furniſhing it ſelf with able paſtours in euery congregation. But to the purpoſe. The negatiue ſeemes to mee moſt probable; and with all that heate of inueighing, I ſee not yet one argument ſoundly prouing, their actions nullities. And for my iudgement I propound theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it hath been proued that the ill life of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter preiudiceth not the ſufficiencie of the Sacrament, therefore neither their ignorance: for it is as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Miniſter that hee be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Secondly, Baptiſme hath been adminiſtred by ſome that had no calling to preach: yea, and that warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and with Chriſts owne allowance the Diſciples of Chriſt; before euer they were ſent out to preach, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred Baptiſme<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 3.22. Ioh. 4.2.</note>. And that this was before their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to preach, appeares by this, that Chriſt himſelfe began not publikely to preach: till <hi>Iohns</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4.12.17.</note>; and at this time when Chriſts Diſciples bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; <hi>Iohn</hi> was not impriſoned<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 3.24.</note>. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome auncient Diuines are of opinion that thoſe to whom <hi>Peter</hi> enioyned the baptiſing of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and his company) were no preachers<note n="d" place="margin">Acts 10.48.</note>.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in Epheſ. cap. <hi>4.</hi>

                  <p>Other reaſons will appeare in anſwere to the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the aduerſe part; which are on this manner.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, euery miniſterie of the new teſtament, is a preaching miniſterie, and therefore ſacraments are nullities that are deliuered by no preachers; for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters onely can giue ſacraments. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, it will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble theſe men, I ſuppoſe, to proue that euery miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the new Teſtament is a preaching Miniſterie: holding their owne

                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence will not eaſily be proued; for be it granted that by Gods ordinance none ſhould be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but who are preachers, will it thence follow; that the action of a no preacher is a nullity? by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance none ſhould be a Miniſter, but who is a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man; now if an vnſanctified man haue by bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or fraud thruſt into that holy calling, are his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore meere nullities<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 23.</note>?</p>

                  <p>Their ſecond Argument whereby they proue them no Miniſters; is becauſe they wait not on their office<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 12.6.7.8.</note>: namely on preaching, the onely eſſentiall propertie of a miniſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> And doth this proue them to be no Miniſters by calling, becauſe they neglect execution? Kings then are no Kings if they vſe not the ſword to puniſh; and their lawfull iniunctions are nullities to the ſubiect, becauſe they faile in the principle worke of their calling, ſhew a deſparitie betweene the two; or elſe learne, they may be Miniſters by office that neglect the execution of their office.</p>
                  <p>Their third obiection is, that vnpreaching Miniſters ſinne in medling with adminiſtration of Sacraments, becauſe that is a paſtorall function.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I demaund whether the action it ſelfe for the matter of it be a ſinne in him; or is it his ſinne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of the faultie manner of performing? If it be in the latter reſpect onely; that I am ſure will not make his action a nullitie to vs; and that materially it is no ſinne in him, me thinkes is euident; becauſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man in place of a paſtour is bound to adminiſter Sacraments; yea and by omitting any paſtorall office he layes open himſelfe to Gods wrath, come he in how hee will, whether ordinately, or by intruſion: for in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie paſtour hath the Lord laide neceſſitie of doing paſtorall offices. Secondly, it remaines yet to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that adminiſtration of Sacraments is ſo appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the perſon of the paſtour, that no other but a compleat paſtour may deale in it.</p>
                  <p>Certainely in the ancient church Deacons vvere aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtents to the Biſhops and Presbyters, in adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of Baptiſme and Euchariſt.</p>

What the word of God hath againſt this; <hi>the ordayning and ſetting a part of ſome perſons, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reading, praying, administration of Sacraments, who yet ſhould not be permitted to deale in publique preaching.</hi> Surely, ſome ſuch order appeares to haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Leuites and Prieſts of the old Tabernacle.

                  <p>In the Apoſtles anſwere, occurres firſt this Caution: I ſpeake after or according to man: firſt, not in mine owne perſon; as if I eyther approued or deuiſed ſuch a deduction; but I Anticipate onely the cauils of prophane carnall men; readier to blaſpheme then to beleeue the truth.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Compariſons muſt not be ſtretched beyond the intention: there can no more be hence collected, but that wee are made righteous by Chriſts obedience, no leſſe then by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience wee vvere made ſinners: or that Chriſt is herein like to <hi>Adam;</hi> that as he conuayed ſinne to his poſteritie, ſo Chriſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to his children.</p>
                  <p>Touching manner of conuayance or communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Apoſtle ſpeakes not. Therefore in this ſenſe, the terme is not vſed in this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Let vs ſee now how the ſcripture vſeth the word: and eſpecially, how in this place and queſtion the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vnderſtands it? The word to iuſtifie, or to be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſignifies ſometimes to acknowledge iuſt, and giue commendation of righteouſnes: as <hi>Luk.</hi> 27.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4 ſo men are ſaid to iuſtifie GOD. Sometimes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, maintaine, defend as iuſt<note n="l" place="margin">Luke 10.29.</note>. ſo to men in reſpect of themſelues or others. Sometimes Metaphorically, or by <hi>Senecdoche,</hi> to free or deliuer; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to abſolue and acquit from crimes whereof a man is accuſed, whether iuſtly, or vniuſtly: or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce iuſt, and giue commendation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note n="m" place="margin">Pro. 17.15.</note>, ſo <hi>Pro.</hi> 1 &amp;c. <hi>callat. cum. Pro.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Iſay</hi> 5.23. Sometimes to giue teſtimonie and reward of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe<note n="n" place="margin">1 Reg. 8.32.</note>. Sometimes to eſteeme, accept, pronounce, righteous<note n="o" place="margin">Rom 2.13.</note>. Theſe ſignifications are many of them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incedent. Let vs enquire in what ſenſe the Apoſtle in this queſtion takes it: vvee ſhall beſt vnderſtand it: firſt, by ſcope of the Apoſtle: ſecondly, by vſe of the word in this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle is this, to ſhew how a poore ſinner guiltie of tranſgreſſion, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from hope of heauen, and lyable to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, may obtaine righteouſnes, ſuch as for which the Lord ſhal at the barre of his iudgement pronounce,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:17336:170"/> and account him righteous, and ſo acquit him from condemnation.</p>
                  <p>That this is the Scope, appeares by that formerly in the Epiſtle; where the Apoſtle hath conuinced all ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> of vnrighteouſneſſe; to this end, that they might ſeeke righteouſneſſe out of themſelues in Chriſt. And willing to giue refreſhing to the wearie ſoule preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with conſcience of ſinne, and priuitie of lacke of righteouſneſſe; he ſets downe, what that righteouſnes is, for which God will accept and account vs righteous: according to this ſcope, then to be iuſtified is to be pronounced &amp; accounted as righteous. Now this being granted to be the Apoſtles drift; ſee we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of a Chriſtian, is that that troubles the conſcience arraigned? what that that giues it peace? I ſpeake now in generall: that that firſt affrights, is feare of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; becauſe of the ſentence of the law, and ſeueritie of the iudge; this firſt in ſenſe<note n="p" place="margin">Acts 16. &amp; 2.37.</note>; but if a man be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded why he feares condemnation, his anſwere will be, becauſe he lackes righteouſneſſe, and knowes GOD to be of pure eyes, hating iniquitie, and not holding the wicked innocent: and till hee ſee ſome righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in which he may ſtand before God, he can neuer be freed from feare of condemnation. Therefore the Apoſtle purpoſeth here to ſhew by what meanes a man may obtaine righteouſnes, ſuch as for which the Lord ſhall accept and account him righteous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, vſe of the Word. The word in this Epiſtle is firſt vſed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>the hearers of the law are not righteous with God; but the doers of the law ſhall be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified:</hi> where I thinke the word muſt thus be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; are not accounted and holden righteous: for, what he in the latter clauſe cals iuſtified, in the former hee tearmes being iuſt with God; that is, in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimation.</p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:17336:171"/>
                  <p>I ſpare heaping vp of teſtimonies for breuities ſake: To be iuſtified then, here, is to be accounted or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for righteous: that which ſome vrge, that to be iuſtified here ſignifies to be acquit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom ſinne, that is, to haue pardon of ſinnes; though the acception be frequent, yet is not pertinent to that place, as the clauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, intimates; compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. as alſo the reaſon of the Apoſtle <hi>this;</hi> euery man a tranſgreſſour, therefore no man iuſtified by the law; that is workes of the law; that is, obedience to the law; or ſecondly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties therein preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe then is this; that no man borne of <hi>Adam</hi> can by workes of the law procure account and eſteeme of righteouſneſſe before GOD: ſo that in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, hee remoues this effect. <hi>(Iustification)</hi> from this cauſe <hi>(workes of the law)</hi> in reſpect of euery ſonne of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence then, let vs obſerue this concluſion; that workes of the law cannot procure the eſteeme of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe with GOD, to any child of <hi>Adam.</hi> Firſt, reaſon of the Apoſtle collected from the illatiue parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>therefore;</hi> and ſtands thus, if we looke back to the Apoſtles diſcourſe. No tranſgreſſour of the law can be iuſtified, that is approued as righteous before God by the workes of the law; but all fleſh, that is, euery ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> is a tranſgreſſour of the law: therefore ſhall no fleſh be counted righteous before God, by vvorkes of the law. The aſſumption hath beene at large proued: <hi>cap.</hi> 1.2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. ſee wee the reaſon of the propoſition; it is this. The law to iuſtification requires continuance in euerie thing therein vvritten, to doe it. Wherefore, ſeeing he that tranſgreſſeth continues not in all things written in the law to do them; apparent that by workes of the law no fleſh can be iuſtified.</p>
                  <p>Second reaſon: or rather the ſame iterated in other
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:17336:171"/> words, is in the latter end of the <hi>verſe,</hi> from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie effect of the law: that is, conuiction of ſinne: thus: If by the law vvee be all conuicted of ſinne; then by vvorkes of the law, can none be iuſtified; but by the law comes knowledge of ſinne; that is, we are conuicted of ſinne: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The aſſumption againe is euident, ſet downe in the Apoſtles words, reaſon of the conſequence; <hi>vt ſupra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowledge of ſinne; not ſo much, <hi>quoad naturam peccati;</hi> for ſo by the law comes the knowledge of righteouſneſſe; but <hi>quoad inhaerentiam in nobis;</hi> that is, if vve looke to the law wee ſhall ſee our vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes diſcouered, and be forced to acknowledge that we are ſinners; therefore can wee neuer looke to obtaine righteouſneſſe by doing of the law: for euen one tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion anihilates righteouſneſſe, in reſpect of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by the law: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>Now wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (trow we) can our aduerſaries obiect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude this ſo direct teſtimonie of the Apoſtle? They diſtinguiſh: firſt of the law: ſecondly, workes: thirdly, iuſtification. Workes of the ceremoniall law, ſay <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> are here excluded, not thoſe of the law morall. <hi>Contra:</hi> marke then how vvorthy a diſputer they haue made the Apoſtle: euery man is a tranſgreſſour of the law morall; <hi>Ergo.</hi> no man can be iuſtified by the workes of the law ceremoniall. Hee meanes by workes of that law, wherof they are tranſgreſſors; that was the law mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: ſecondly, he concludes of all men both Iewes and Gentils that neither Gentiles by workes of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor Iewes by workes of law written, can be iuſtified. Now to the Gentils was not the law of ceremonies giuen: thirdly, hee meanes workes of that law, by vvhich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth knowledge of ſin, but that is the law moral<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note>, &amp; that of ceremonies, doth not directly, but ſecondarily, &amp; by accident conuince of ſin, fourthly, he meanes that law
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:17336:172" rendition="simple:additions"/> by which the true meanes of iuſtifying a ſinner is not reuealed, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. but the law of ceremonies, in ſacrifices and other types, though obſcurely, reueale Gods righteouſneſſe; namely, Chriſt the ende of the law for righteouſneſſe<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 10</note>. It remaines then: that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes of all workes, of all law, whether ceremoniall or morall.</p>
                  <p>Of workes they diſtinguiſh thus, according to their principle, and time of doing: <hi>de iuſtitia &amp; operibus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, quae fidem &amp; gratiam dei praecedunt:</hi> ſo <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> ſo <hi>Rhemists,</hi> of workes Moral done without faith, and the grace of God: that is, as they muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; of workes done by infidels, and ſuch as are not yet members of the church: but <hi>contra. Gal.</hi> 2.15.16. directly preuents this cauill: ſecondly, the Apoſtle hath of purpoſe conuinced the people of God of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ver e</hi> 19. to ſhew, that euen they could be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their workes, though done in faith: thirdly, the reaſon of the Apoſtle will conclude workes of grace; for if whoſoeuer tranſgreſſeth the law cannot be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by workes of the law, then neither they that haue faith, and are in ſtate of grace; ſith they alſo are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors: fourthly, vvorkes done in grace and faith follow iuſtification. <hi>Ergo,</hi> cauſe it not.</p>
                  <p>Of iuſtification: this is of two ſorts, or hath two degrees; firſt, whereby a ſinner is made iuſt inherently: ſecondly, whereby a man being now iuſt is made more iuſt inherently too: that is, hath inward righteouſneſſe encreaſed in him. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, ſcripture is not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the firſt and ſecond iuſtification; for iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in this queſtion the ſcripture vſeth it, is <hi>actus indiuiduus:</hi> ſecondly, that which they call iuſtification: ſcripture termes ſanctification; and diſtinguiſh it from iuſtification thirdly, it is apparantly the Apoſtle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſhevv how a ſinner a may attaine righteouſnes,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:17336:172"/> not how he may encreaſe it: here therfore the place for that diſtinction: we conclude then, that no man can be iuſtified by any workes of the law. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now before I paſſe from this place, the queſtion fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offers it ſelfe to be diſcuſſed, whether workes of the law, are here wholly and abſolutely excluded from power of iuſtifying: or onely our workes of the law, as done by vs; briefely whether hee exclude as well the obedience of Chriſt to the law performed for vs: as our owne obedience and doing the workes enioyned in the law. This queſtion hath been but of late moued, and was neuer thought off by the firſt reſtorers of our faith, though exerciſed long in the queſtion of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: the more I wonder at the peremptorineſſe of thoſe that now preſſe the affirmatiue; and ſure if the caſe were mine owne, I ſhould a little ſuſpect my ſelfe of ſingularitie and be iealous of mine eye-ſight, leaſt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after noueltie, had ſomething dazeled me. And for the opinion generally receiued, let me ſay thus much in generall; that it ſufficeth to the Apoſtles pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to exclude vvorkes of the law done by our ſelues; firſt, hereby is man as much abaſed, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Gods grace as much magnified, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.6.7. thirdly, neceſſitie equally laid on vs to ſeeke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe out of our ſelues in Chriſt: fourthly, heart as much inflamed to loue God: fiftly, conſcience as well ſetled in a ſweet peace: ſixtly, obiections as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently anſwered: ſeauenthly, ſhall I adde, (vvhich I preſume is all the aduerſe part can plead) ſcripture as eaſily and currently explaned; all vvhich ſo being, though I vvould haue no man for pretenſe of noueltie, to reiect a truth clearely euidenced in the word; nor am ſo prophane as to chooſe to erre with many, rather then to thinke truth vvith few: yet ſure, I ſhould much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my ſelfe in ſuch a caſe, vvhere I goe alone, and vvould not eaſily be brought to diuulge my conceits
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17336:173"/> ſuppoſedly true, conſidering what an ope I ſhould giue to aduerſaries, to taxe of leuitie and vncertaintie in foundations: though I know this taken at worſt, is but hay or ſtubble, built on the foundation.</p>
                  <p>Now to the point; I take it, it cannot be ſhewen to be the Apoſtles purpoſe to exclude workes of the law abſolutely, but onely as done, or to be done by vs. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; firſt, this ſufficeth to the Apoſtles purpoſe; <hi>vt ſupra:</hi> ſecondly, this particle <hi>(done by vs)</hi> is in ſome Texts directly expreſſed; in ſome others by good conſequence deduced<note n="y" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.

Becauſe this ſpeciall faith breedes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but perturbation, diſquietneſſe, and euen deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the minde: becauſe a man may be deceaued in his ſpeciall perſwaſion; and <hi>Caluin</hi> requires a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of remiſſion of ſinnes, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to life in euery iuſtified man. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, it is not faith ſpeciall, but lacke of it that breedes diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> Secondly, and though ſome men are deceiued in their opinion and perſwaſion of iuſtification and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to life as M. <hi>Caluin</hi> at large ſheweth, that haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Laruam fides,</hi> yet will it follow thence, that none other may haue infallible perſwaſion of their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and adoption? that in deede haue the ſpirit to witneſſe it vnto them<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>.

Fourthly, where teacheth M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> that faith conſidered in ſubiects, as it is in Gods children, is free from doubtings? nay, ſheweth he not that the deareſt of Gods Saints haue conflicts with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity?

                  <p>His third reaſon; becauſe whom God fauours, and wils well vnto, him he makes ſuch as hee would haue him: otherwiſe Gods beneuolence ſhould be a vaine and emptie good will: therefore to be iuſtified by grace is not to be reputed iuſt, when wee are not; but to be indeede iuſt, holy, and immaculate. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now what when all this is granted, that Gods grace, is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his effect in vs? we yeeld that this effect, iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, flowes from this cauſe, the grace of God. Wee are iuſtified by grace: but how doth this proue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; that by grace we are here to vnderſtand righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe infuſed, and not rather the free fauour and loue of God? ſecondly, we yeeld that by this fauour of God wee are made iuſt indeede, before euer we be iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reputed, and approued for righteous: this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will fall out fitlieſt to be handled, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17336:184" rendition="simple:additions"/> how or in what order we come to eſteeme and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſnes before God; firſt, therefore, in execution of Gods purpoſe to iuſtifie and ſaue, is that worke of GOD, effectuall calling; whereby faith is wrought in vs: to beleeuers, is Chriſt, with all his righteouſneſſe giuen, ſo that whatſoeuer Chriſt hath or vvrought, becomes ours, by free yet true donation: thus enioying Chriſt and his merit, we are preſented to Gods iudgement ſeate; and there receiue the ſentence of abſolution and approbation for righteous: truely therefore are we made righteous, before we be eſteemed righteous; yet not by righteouſneſſe inherent in vs, though that accompany iuſtification: but by donation of Chriſts righteouſnes vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, for ought they haue yet alledged, grace may here ſignifie the fauour and free loue of God: and couple this grace with <hi>gratis,</hi> freely by grace; mee thinkes, it is as much as if hee had ſaid, meerely by grace, vvithout any concurrence of vvorkes, ſo much as of adiuvant cauſes to iuſtification: which alſo other ſcriptures affirme. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.5.6.7.</p>

                     <hi>Senſe: Redemption,</hi> is that act of Chriſt the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, whereby hee hath ranſomed vs from our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies; in this place by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of the end, put for the meane deſtinied thereto: it ſignifies the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, made by Chriſt to the iuſtice of his Father: and this ſatisfaction, ſome well diſtinguiſh on this manner; it is eyther <hi>Legis</hi> or <hi>Crucis.</hi> Vnder the firſt, they compriſe the obedience of his life, performed to the law: by the ſecond they vnderſtand his whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that had conſummation vpon the Croſſe: and this did the order of Diuine iuſtice require which could not haue beene kept, if God by his owne power and will without ſatisfaction for ſinne, had repared mankinde; as <hi>Thomas</hi> well ſaith.<note place="margin">Thom.

                  <p>If we take it in the firſt ſenſe, me thinkes it excludes all humane ſatisfactions from power of iuſtifying; for if by the price paide by Chriſt onely, wee be iuſtified, then not by any price paide by our ſelues; or any other meere creature for vs: and in truth, how can we, duſt and aſhes, once conceite ſuch a power to be in vs? ſith our weldoing reacheth not vnto God<note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 16.2.

                  <p>Is it not then a ſtrange concluſion of our aduerſaries? that man in grace, may make ſome kinde of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſinne of his ſoule?<note place="margin">Bellar. de de poeniten. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> Let vs ſee their opinion, as they haue nicely minced it out, and propounded it
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17336:185"/> vnto vs by parcells: of ſatisfaction therefore, they make two kindes or degrees rather: the one is abſolute, and euery way perfect; wherein is rendered, a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on completely anſwering to the perfect equalitie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iuſtice; the other imperfect, anſwering but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly to the breach of ſome iuſtice; and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth God to accept it, for full ſatisfaction, at the hands of his children, being reconciled vnto him. Touching the firſt kinde or degree of ſatisfaction, they ſeeme to confeſſe, that it is quite out of the power of any meere creature; partly, becauſe whatſoeuer wee are or haue, we are and haue from God; partly becauſe them m ieſtie offended, is infin te, and all that wee are or haue, is finite: ſo that, except there be ſome accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or donation on Gods part, there can be no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made by men; but if wee ſpeake of a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is ſuch by Diuine acceptation or donation, this is in the power of euery iuſtified man: beſides this, in ſinne they conſider two things; <hi>culpam &amp; poenum;</hi> fault and puniſhment; now, that for fault they make meerely free, in reſpect of vs; and aſcribe it onely to Chriſt, the mediatour: for puniſhment, they make two ſorts; eternall and temporall; for eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſts paſſion onely ſatisfies; for temporall power is giuen vs, by grace, to make acceptable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Next, they aſſigne what theſe workes ſatisfactorie are; namely prayer, faſting, almes deedes: ſo that now, if wee ſumme vp their doctrine of ſatisfactions it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this: that a iuſtified man, may by faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prayer, almes deedes, make ſuch ſatisfaction as GOD vvill accept, for the temporall puniſhment of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Shall we heare their proofes? Firſt <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thy ſinnes by righteouſneſſe.</hi> Sinnes therefore
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17336:186" rendition="simple:additions"/> may be ſatisfied for. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Diuines well anſwere, that they ill render the originall vvord; vvhich in no vſe of Hebrewes, or Chaldees, ſignifies to redeeme, but to breake off; and let them if they can ſhew inſtance to the contrarie: ſecondly, that the phraſe is neuer read in ſcriptures, to redeeme ſinnes; redemption being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes applyed to perſons: thirdly, it is me thinkes not a little croſſing to their owne doctrine, that make their ſatisfactions proper to iuſtified men; in number where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they cannot place <hi>Nabuchadnezzar:</hi> fourthly, that if ſatisfaction vvere here intimated, no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it ſhould haue reference to Gods iuſtice, but to mens iniuries.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond teſtimonie is <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. <hi>bring forth meete fruits of repentance:</hi> that is, now, they cannot be meete or vvorthy fruits of repentance, except they be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to recompence the wrong done; if not inequalitie of quantitie, yet at leaſt in equalitie of proportion, and according to the acceptation of him that was wronged: and here they lay on loade with teſtimonies of Fathers. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But what the fruits of repentance are, vvho can better expound, then <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> himſelfe? <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>ad</hi> 14. Which if ye reade, ye ſhall finde, to be nothing elſe, but a ceaſing to doe euill, and a learning to doe vvell: and they deceiue the world with the homonymie of their Latine <hi>poenitentiae:</hi> the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies nothing elſe, but a change of the minde: and ſo proportionally, the fruits of a changed minde, are nothing but actions of a new life, beſeeming and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a changed heart.</p>
                  <p>The third teſtimonie is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Where amongſt fruits of a godly ſorrow, is reckoned vp, reuenge or puniſhment. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, whither this puniſhment, be that that the repentant partie takes of himſelfe, or which the Church inflicted on the inceſtuous perſon, is
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17336:186"/> queſtionable: their owne <hi>Caietane</hi> ſo interprets, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to the ſentence of excommunication paſſed on the inceſtuous perſon: the end whereof, who euer taught to be ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice? Secondly, be it granted, that it ſignifies reuenge, which the penitent takes of himſelfe, by barring himſelfe of his lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings, in reſpect of his immoderate purſuit of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleaſures, and the like; is this a ſatisfaction to God for former ſinnes of his ſoule? what ſcripture; what Father ſo teacheth?</p>
                  <p>The next teſtimonie <hi>Leuit.</hi> 4.5. &amp; 6. Where are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſacrifices of diuers value, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of offences: and theſe ſacrifices were ſatisfactions, and expiations of the guilt of temporall puniſhment. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That they may iuſtly be termed expiatorie ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, wee yeeld; yet in this ſenſe onely; <hi>quatenus</hi> the name of the truth ſignified, may be giuen to Types, ſignifying the truth: a phraſe of ſpeech vſuall in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when matters Typicall or Sacramentall are enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated.</p>
                  <p>The onely true expiatorie ſacrifice, was that of Chriſt on the croſſe<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note>: ſignified by theſe types, in the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall law. Neither can it be proued, that the actes of offring them, purged otherwiſe then legally. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Chriſtes bloud, which in theſe types their faith beheld, alone hauing power to purge the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. Their other teſtimonies I ſpare mentioning; and come now briefely to examine their diſtinctions, out of which, they haue nicely framed, this their carnall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſatisfactions.</p>
                  <p>Satisfactions then they would haue to be of two ſorts; ſome euery way aequable to the offence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iuſtice; ſuch they gently yeeld, there are none per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ormable by any meere man: but an other ſort there is, which they call acceptable; that is, ſuch as
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:17336:187" rendition="simple:additions"/> God accepts for ſatisfactions, and amends made to his iuſtice for the ſinne of our ſoules. And will you heare what effect they aſcribe vnto them? they haue not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, they ſay to reſtore, or recouer amitie with God; but yet this they can doe, ſatisfie his iuſtice; at leaſt for guilt of temporall puniſhments, to be ſuffered in purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Now firſt, where finde they eyther tearmes, or grounds of this diſtinction? we reade indeed, that our ſeruices of new obedience are ſacrifices acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD through Ieſus Chriſt<note n="vv" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note>: but that they are ſatisfactions to his iuſtice, eyther by abſolute correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, or acceptable proportion wee finde not. Secondly, ſee how in explication of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, they confound themſelues. Can they ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie iuſtice? then ſure they may remoue offence: can they remoue offence? they can alſo reſtore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and amitie with God. For is there any thing that is offenſiue to God, but the violation of Iuſtice? ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his iuſtice, thou ſhalt ſure haue him propitious. Thirdly, tell vs I pray you, without halting, whither is firſt, in order of nature ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice, or reconciliation? If our olde bookes faile vs not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the ſcripture deceiueth vs not, ſatisfaction euen plenarie goes before as the meane; reconcilement followes, as the end whereto that tended. Therefore, if wee be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles perfectly, ſatisfactions are performed; if ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions plenarie be not performed, wee are ſure not reconciled.</p>
                  <p>And that they prattle of temporarie puniſhment, reſerued for vs to ſuffer for ſatisfaction for veniall ſins; vvhat doth it but impeach the al-ſufficient ſacrif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 1.3.36.</note>: or thirdly, according to their grounds, lay crime of iniuſtice vpon the Maieſtie of God: that hauing receiued perfect ſatisfaction in the bloud of his ſonne, and thereby as themſelues, cleared vs from all fault, ſhould yet puniſh vs being vvholie faultleſſe, at leaſt by imputation.</p>

                  <p>And withall, aſſures vs of our preſeruation in ſtate of grace, till full poſſeſſion of that glorious life purchaſed for vs by the merit of Chriſt: <hi>For if when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we were reconciled, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>The condition required of vs, to make this propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation effectuall to vs, is faith; declared by the obiect, <hi>Christs bloud:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, by reſting and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the death and obedience of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

And had almoſt rather define with ſchoole-men, that Chriſt merited from the firſt inſtant of his conception, then thus limit his meritorious and expiatorie ſatisfaction to his laſt act in death. Reaſons of this <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> ſeeme
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17336:190" rendition="simple:additions"/> theſe: firſt, becauſe in his death was the complement of his humiliation<note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 2.</note>: ſecondly, it ſerued beſt for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Iewiſh opinion, of legall ſacrifices offered in bloud of beaſts<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 9.</note>: thirdly, moſt ſenſibly anſwered to the types of Iewiſh law, &amp;c.</p>

But yet this is true, that affiance in Chriſtes merit, is a fruit of faith iuſtifying; and the very act of affiance or putting truſt in Chriſt, required of vs, to our iuſtification, which if no other Scripture affirmed, yet this euidently auoucheth: and can we thinke this floweth from a generall beleeuing of the hiſtory of the Goſpell? yea, can it ariſe from any thing, but particular euidence of our title to Chriſts merit.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond euidence of confidence in Chriſt, and his merit for righteouſneſſe, is deteſtation of all Teachers and doctrines in any ſort raſing this foundation and pillar of our confidence. How ſtoutly the Apoſtle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt ſuch, who ſo reades his whole Epiſtle to the Galathians may iudge, with what earneſtneſſe of affection enuies hee againſt thoſe, that in this Article of iuſtification, deſired to mingle <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, faith and works of any ſort?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Senſe: To declare his righteouſneſſe.]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, If any aske a reaſon, why God ordayned Chriſt to propitiate, and that by his bloud; it was, to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe iuſt in forgiuing ſinnes. To omit variety of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; by iuſtice of God, we may beſt vnderſtand, his iudiciall iuſtice, which ſome call, remunerating, or diſtributiue; a property enclining him to reward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; to puniſh diſobedience. Now, for that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to deale mercifully with man in forgiuing ſinnes, and yet iuſtly too, in puniſhing diſobedience; (for God cannot ſo be mercifull, as to impeach his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 116.5.</note>) this way his Diuine wiſedome deuiſed for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull forgiueneſſe; to deliuer his ſonne to dye for our ſinnes, that iuſtice might be ſatisfied; and withall, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ouerflowe to the Elect in forgiuing iniquitie and ſinne.</p>

                     <hi>To declare his iustice in forgiuing ſinnes:]</hi> That is, that he might be acknowledged iuſt, euen while of mercy he forgaue ſinnes.

It was that about which the <hi>Sophies</hi> of all times buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but were in all their deuiſes fruſtrate; by light of nature they knew iuſtice muſt receiue ſatisfaction, before euer mercy could haue paſſage, from that Father of mercies, to the ſonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> Hence were their faſtings, ſacrifices, ſometimes offered in mans bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, in bloud of their owne ſonnes and daughters;

                  <p>Secondly, mee thinkes if there were none other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument this alone ſufficiently ouerthrowes all that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Popiſh ſatisfactions, for reconciliation: for can there be no meane of propitiation, but what yeelds ſatisfaction to diuine iuſtice? will not the Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull in forgiuing ſinnes? Nay, can be not be mercifull in forgiuing ſinnes, till iuſtice be ſatisfied? then ſure, humane ſufferings, and almes, and prayers, muſt needs be acknowledged to be no ſacrifices propitiatorie for the ſinnes of our ſoules. But hereof before.</p>

                  <p>Now if it be true, their ſinnes were remitted: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they iuſtified and reconciled vnto GOD, by faith in Chriſt to come: thirdly, were adopted for ſonnes: how can it be imagined, that they were thus puniſhed?

                  <p>Thirdly, it is a ruled opinion of many their Diuines, that it is a greater puniſhment, to be depriued of Gods preſence, then to feele any other the paines of hell; and that the anguiſh is more, to conſider that depriuall of glory, then to feele the ſmart of any other infernall torment; which if it be ſo; then ſure the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was theirs that yet are confeſſed to haue liued and dyed high in Gods fauour. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <p>Come we now to the particular aſſumed; but boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, doctrine of workes excludes not; doctrine of Faith excludes, and may wee not then conclude vvith the Apoſtle? that a man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the law.</p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:17336:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Let vs a little examine the aſſumption: ſenſe; <hi>law of workes:</hi> that is, doctrine of workes: that is, teaching that wee are iuſtified by workes. <hi>Law of faith,</hi> that is, doctrine of faith; as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies; for the truth of it, both members are to be ſcanned; firſt, that doctrine of iuſtification by workes excludes not boaſting: ſecondly, that that of faith excludes it.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, conſider wee vvhat it is, that by doctrine, requiring vvorkes to iuſtification, is to be performed by him, that will that vvay be iuſtified: and that is, a doing of the whole law<note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 5.3. Rom. 10.5.</note>, and that by the perſon himſelfe, that lookes for iuſtification. And is not this, to puffe vp the proud heart of man vvith conceit of abilitie to iuſtifie himſelfe? What prouder doctrine then that of Pelagians? teaching that by naturall abilities, the law might perfectly be kept to iuſtification. That of Papiſts, is not all out ſo groſſe; they teach, that nature helped by grace, may doe this: and, that by workes done in grace, ſome iuſtification may be atchieued: they diminiſh boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, but exclude it not. It vvere long, to rake vp all they teach, touching power of will in nature: how it deſerues <hi>ex congruo,</hi> euen before grace recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But haply, by that they teach of the neceſſarie aſſiſtance of grace to iuſtification, they amend the matter. Surely little or nothing. For let a man view all they teach touching the efficacie of grace, in this point of iuſtification: hee ſhall finde it to amount to this ſumme onely: that grace doth little more then bring out that power, that is in nature, into act; or heale a little the wound, that ſinne hath made; or confirme weakeneſſe naturall: ſo making nature, to goe cheeke by iole vvith grace, in the act of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17336:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> and is this to exclude boaſting? and not rather to occaſion it?</p>
                  <p>Let vs ſee now vvhether the doctrine of faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle. But conſider vvee how: <hi>viz.</hi> in as much as it teacheth to goe out of our ſelues for righteouſneſſe; and makes vs, no more but receiuers of that righteouſneſſe, vvhereby vvee are iuſtified; vvrought by Chriſt, giuen by GOD the Father, receiued by faith<note n="v" place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note>, according to this doctrine, vvhat cauſe hath man to boaſt? Perhaps they vvill ſay of this, that he beleeued: and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, accepted the righteouſneſſe offered? as if a beggar ſhould boaſt of his vvealth, and aſcribe it to his labour, whereas all hee did was but to receiue, what the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eralitie of almoners pleaſed to beſtow; yea in the caſe betwixt GOD and vs, man hath not ſo much to boaſt of, ſith very power to receiue is alſo the gift of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion now may vvell be inferred, that therefore a man is iuſtified by faith without workes of the law.</p>
                  <p>And what haue aduerſaries of grace, trow wee, to except againſt this round argument of the Apoſtle? Forſooth they labour by a diſtinction of boaſting,<note place="margin">De iustif. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </note> to elude all. So <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> the Apoſtle excludes not all boaſting, but that onely, vvhich ariſeth of workes done by ſole power of freewill; for hee ſaith not, <hi>vbi est gloriatio?</hi> Where is the boaſting? but <hi>vbi est glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatio tua?</hi> Where is thy boaſting? the boaſting wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou glorieſt in thy ſelfe, and not in the Lord; now in reſpect of vvorkes done of faith, and ſo by grace, no man can glorie but in the Lord; and that boaſting is not prohibited: for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let him that glorieth, glorie in the Lord</hi>
                     <note n="vv" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note>.</p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:17336:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>The ſumme is this, that boaſting in our ſelues onely is forbidden and not boaſting in the Lord: and that is ſufficiently excluded by this, that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, workes done by power of nature, vvithout aide of grace, to be vnable to iuſtifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ. Plauſibly.</hi> The diſtinction of boaſting, wee graunt, if they yeeld vs thus much, that all glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſelues, is excluded; for wee liſt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about quiddities; though <hi>Bellarmines (tua)</hi> be not found in the text. And thus propound the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ground; a man muſt be iuſtified by ſuch a meanes as vvhereby hee may haue no cauſe at all to glorie in himſelfe: but muſt tranſcribe the whole glorie of iuſtification, to the grace of GOD: and hence thus aſſume.</p>
                  <p>But by doctrine of workes, whether done by ſole power of nature, or mixtly by grace and nature, all boaſting is not excluded; <hi>Ergo,</hi> that not the meane of iuſtification. Our <hi>minor</hi> for the firſt part, is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by aduerſaries; and doe they not ſee, how their mingling of grace and nature, leaues ſtill ſome cauſe of boaſting to our proud nature? Am I a coworker with grace by power naturall, and depends the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of grace, vpon the aſſent of my will? then ſure in reſpect of my coagencie, and aſſent, be it leſſe or more, I haue ſome cauſe to boaſt of my ſelfe, and ſo, all boaſting in my ſelfe is not excluded; but all boaſting in our ſelues, muſt be excluded; therefore all workes vvhatſoeuer whether done by ſole power of nature as <hi>Pelagians;</hi> or by nature and grace mixtly, as Popiſh Semipelagians now teach, are here excluded from iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this argument: let all ſuch as deſire to informe themſelues, in this weightieſt point, wherein
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:17336:197" rendition="simple:additions"/> errours are moſt daungerous, bring doctrines on both ſides taught, to this touchſtone. If Popiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, here hold current, let them embrace it, if it take away all boaſting from man, hold it firme: but if it puffe vp the proud heart of man, in the leaſt meaſure, as indeed it doth, reiect it as a doctrine of Diuels; and hold the teachers thereof, though Seraphicall, for euer accurſed: it ſerues not the turne, to ſay, they aſcribe Iuſtificatorie vvorkes to grace of God; for firſt, what doe they herein, more then the Phariſee<note n="x" place="margin">Luc 18.11.12.</note>: I thanke God (ſaith he) not my ſelfe, that I am thus and thus: and yet is diſmiſſed vvithout iuſtification: and ſecondly, all they aſcribe to grace, is but an aſſiſtance of nature; or a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie at moſt, in workes that iuſtifie; and by aſſociating nature with grace, giue vs at leaſt ſome cauſe to boaſt of our ſelues? for ſure, if we be eyther principals, or in the leaſt meaſure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iutours to our iuſtification, vvee haue ſome cauſe of boaſting: but it is wholly excluded by the true Doctrine of iuſtification.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Second reaſon for iuſtification by faith without workes of the Law. From abſurdities; if by workes of the Law, and not by faith onely; one of theſe two abſurdities vvill follow; that eyther God is God of the Iewes onely, and not of the Gentiles alſo; or elſe that hee is variable in this action of iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; iuſtifying the Iewes, by works of the law; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by faith; but God is not the God of Iewes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of Gentiles alſo; and is one; that is, vnvaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this act of iuſtifying. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                     <hi>Is he God of Iewes onely? &amp;c.</hi> That is, hee hath now vnder the new Teſtament accepted Gentiles, into his couenant of grace. The tenour whereof read <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33, &amp;c. But as touching the conſequence of the propoſition, it may be enquired how it flowes? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe that vnto Iewes onely was the Law giuen in writing<note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 147.

                     </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law. If therefore iuſtification be by workes of the Law, Iewes onely ſhall be capable of that
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17336:199" rendition="simple:additions"/> bleſſing; and the Gentiles, whoſe God the Lord hath couenanted to be, ſhall lacke this principall bleſſing, promiſed in the couenant; iuſtification. But that is abſurd. <hi>For God is one.</hi> This oneneſſe as I may terme it, of God, is not numerall, as in other places<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note>, but hath reference, eyther to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſſe of God, and his keeping one ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and vnvaried courſe in iuſtifying all; or to the indifferencie, and vnpartiality of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, of all ſorts. <hi>Within the couenant.</hi> If we take it in the firſt ſenſe, they contayne a ſecond abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, iſſuing from the doctrine of iuſtification by workes of law written, vrged by Iewes; in as much as then it will follow, that the Lord doth not, by one meanes iuſtificall. But Gentiles by faith, Iewes by works of the Law; but all are iuſtified by one and ſame meanes; ſith God is one vnchangeable in his courſes.</p>
                  <p>If wee take it in the other ſenſe, as noting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of Gods affection to all in the couenant, it is a reaſon of the clauſe fore-going; <hi>viz.</hi> that God is God of Gentiles alſo.</p>

                  <p>But that we may here note, is, that the bleſſing of iuſtification belongs to all in the couenant, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iewes or Gentiles beleeuing: ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33.34. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.8.9 10.11.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Oe we then aboliſh the law by faith?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> If we be iuſtified by faith onely, it ſhould ſeeme the Law is vtterly aboliſhed. <hi>Anſ</hi> Firſt, the conſequent is denied and reiected vvith Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call horrour, <hi>God forbid.</hi> Secondly, the contrarie is auouched: as if hee ſhould ſay, we are ſo farre from antiquating the law, by doctrine of faith, that wee rather eſtabliſh it. <hi>By faith</hi> vnderſtand doctrine of faith, or teaching that we are iuſtified by faith.</p>
                  <p>Whence then, wee haue theſe two concluſions; firſt, that the doctrine of iuſtification by faith, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth not the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that ſame doctrine ſtabliſheth the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now for the firſt of theſe, the explanation is not all out ſo difficult; for what though by teaching faith, wee make the law vneffectuall to iuſtification? followeth it thence, that it is in euery reſpect abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and to all purpoſes vneffectuall? There are ſundrie other ends of the law, for which it ought to ſtand in vſe in the Church of GOD: As firſt, to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:17336:200"/> bring vs to knowledge of ſinne<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3. &amp; 5.</note>: ſecondly, to be a rule of life<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 5.</note>: thirdly, to be meane of continuall humiliation, and ſundry the like.</p>
                  <p>But how by this doctrine wee eſtabliſh the Law, requires more diligent inquiſition. Varietie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, I am loath to cloy the Reader with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; yet ſome few of the moſt probable, it vvill not be impertinent to propound. Some thus; faith ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth the Law, as it is a rule of life: vvhile it workes by loue, which is the fulfilling of the Law. But the queſtion is as I take it, how the Apoſtle teaching that wee are iuſtified by faith, doth in ſo teaching, ſtabliſh the Law? <hi>Doe we aboliſh the Law? and wee stabliſh the Law: viz.</hi> wee that teach a man to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith, euen whiles wee ſo teach, or by this very doctrine, ſtabliſh the Law.</p>
                  <p>I therefore iudge with the beſt moderne interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">Paraeus &amp; Beza.</note> that the Law is thus farre eſtabliſhed by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith; that the righteouſneſſe, which it requireth, <hi>quod ad materiam,</hi> is not aboliſhed; but rather ſtabliſhed. In as much as vvhat it requires, <hi>Doe this and liue,</hi> wee haue it in Chriſt by beleeuing. Faith finding in him, what man cannot finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the perfect obedience which the Law enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſay, then belike we are iuſtified by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It implies no abſurdity to ſpeake ſo in a ſenſe. For according to iudgement of beſt Diuines, Legall and Euangelicall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe differ, not in matter, but <hi>efficiente &amp; modo:</hi> wee haue the ſame righteouſneſſe vvhich the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; but yet in other manner, then the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it: the Law required it of our owne perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; the Goſpell teacheth, it ſufficeth to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17336:201"/> that it be for vs performed by our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Chriſt Ieſus, and apprehended of vs by faith.</p>
                  <p>And if this be <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, then I hope it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; that Chriſts actiue obedience enters our iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>And then, there is ſome end of imputation; that it may become ours. And this I am ſure is the olde way, and as I yet iudge, the good way: in it I finde as much reſt to my ſoule, as in that other <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> ſome haue framed.</p>
                  <p>In this point ſo weighty, I will be glad to learne; but can ſcarce be perſwaded; the truth hath hitherto lien hid, from ſo many of Gods Saints, ſo purpoſely conuerſant in this queſtion. And though I am not ſo Popiſh, as to meaſure truth by multitude, yet ſure me thinks, where other things are equall, as learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> induſtry; ſincerity, prayer to God for reuelation; I had rather impute errour to one then many.</p>
